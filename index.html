Diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, Dee&rsquo;s son ingested prescription medications and cleaning supplies then soaked himself with gasoline and lit himself on fire. When his burns no longer required hospitalization the doctors said he was free to go and he did not need in-patient psychiatric treatment. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t think that he would ever have done this had he not been driven by forces in his mind,&rdquo; Dee says.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<section class="row">
	<div class="large-9 large-centered medium-11 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p class="lead">Dee Fleming tried to protect her son from the voices in his head, the ones that told him he should die.</p>
		<p>She chased after him the night he ran toward the neighborhood church with a baseball bat in his hand. She worried to the point of exhaustion when he didn&rsquo;t come home at night, then returned beat-up and missing his watch. She thought she was holding it together, if barely.</p>
		<p>One day last April, when he was oddly quiet and confused, almost catatonic, Fleming took him to Swedish Medical Center&rsquo;s emergency room and told doctors he was suicidal.</p>
		<p>They sent him home.</p>
		<p>Two days later, Fleming&rsquo;s son downed dozens of prescription medications and household cleaning supplies, doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire in her front yard. He lived only because a neighbor called 911 to report something smoldering on the lawn. A police officer who knew him kept him conscious until an ambulance arrived.</p>
		<p>What came next for the Fleming family was almost as shocking, a battle for treatment that epitomizes the massive breakdown in care for mental illness in Colorado and the nation.</p>
		<p>Doctors treated his burns&mdash;but not his mind.</p>
		<p>Despite the family&rsquo;s pleas and a months-long battle, their 37-year-old son was released from Porter Adventist Hospital to a transitional shelter.</p>
		<p>The mental health care system is in crisis. More than 50 years after states began shuttering mental institutions, the system hasn&rsquo;t recovered&mdash;leaving emergency rooms, jails and shelters as last-ditch stops to handle the most severe cases.</p>
		<p>Each year in Colorado, about 260,000 adults and children need treatment for the most severe mental illnesses&mdash;schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and serious emotional disturbances. Yet tens of thousands go without care; nationally, only about a third of people who need treatment get it.</p>
		<p>Colorado is paying millions of dollars to treat people with severe mental illness after their disease has escalated to the point of catastrophe instead of investing more in care when it strikes. Of the $887 million spent in Colorado on mental health in 2010 from all sources, half went to treatment of needy patients in clinics and state psychiatric hospitals. The rest was spent in prisons, jails, hospital emergency rooms and psychiatric units, and the child welfare system.</p>
		<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t as simple as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="Tooltips are awesome, you should totally use them!">limited government resources</span>. Hospitals get more money from insurance companies by fixing physical conditions rather than mental ones, and they refer to their psychiatric units&mdash;if they have them&mdash;as charitable operations.</p>
		<p>The fallout from this shortage in care is severe: suicides, mass shootings, a huge population of prisoners, the homeless on the streets.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only condition for which we wait until stage 4 to try to treat,&rdquo; said Moe Keller, a former state senator and now vice president of public policy for <a href="http://www.mhacolorado.org/" title="Mental Health America of Colorado website">Mental Health America of Colorado</a>. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t do this with cancer. If someone went to their doctor with a tumor, they wouldn&rsquo;t say wait until stage 4. But they do it with mental health.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Families struggle to find help before it&rsquo;s too late, navigating a confusing health system with too few options and battling a Colorado law they say is so weak that they can&rsquo;t make treatment decisions when their loved ones are too sick to realize they need help.</p>
		<p>Attempts to <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25831191/debate­-rages­-colorado­-over-involuntary­-holds­-mental­-illness" title="Debate rages in Colorado over involuntary holds for mental illness - The Denver Post">strengthen that law have failed</a>, even after violent events in Colorado have raised alarms over failures of the country&rsquo;s mental health system. And even as Colorado&rsquo;s suicide rate has risen to the <a href="https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures" title="Understanding suicide: Facts and figures - American Foundation for Suicide Prevention">sixth highest in the nation</a>.</p>
		<p>The state ranks near the bottom in per-capita psychiatric treatment beds reported by hospitals, and in the bottom half in per-capita state and federal spending on mental health.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Fighting for help</h3>

		<p class="lead">Dee Fleming&rsquo;s son&mdash;burned so severely on his torso, arms and legs that he had to wear a skin suit&mdash;spent 10 months in University Hospital&rsquo;s burn unit. His mother recalls just four psychiatric visits during that time, and when his burns no longer required hospitalization, doctors said he was free to go. He did not need in-patient psychiatric treatment for his schizoaffective disorder, they said.</p>
		<p>Only when the Flemings hired a lawyer and threatened to sue the hospital did University administrators find their son a bed at a psychiatric center called Bridge House. A psychiatrist there recommended a 90-day hold, diagnosing serious mental health issues that put him in danger.</p>
		<p>But the burns were too severe for Bridge House to treat, and within days the center sent him to Porter Adventist Hospital. Porter kept him for just four days, determining he no longer needed in-patient care. The hospital released him to a temporary, assisted-living shelter for people with mental illness.</p>
		<p>It was freezing cold in the middle of winter, and his burns were still healing. &ldquo;They gave him a blanket and said goodbye,&rdquo; Fleming said. &ldquo;This is not humanity.&rdquo;</p>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="large-12 large-centered medium-12 medium-centered small-12 columns">
				<div class="centerphoto">
					<img src="./img/breakdown-22394x.jpg" alt="Dee stands in her front yard" />
					<p class="caption">Dee stands in her front yard at the spot where her son attempted suicide. He ingested chemicals and lit himself on fire, &ldquo;I turned it into my sacred place. It helped me think of it a little bit differently. It still is a daily reminder of what happened. I&rsquo;m saddened by what it was but I&rsquo;m hopeful for what it can be,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still a day by day journey for his mental health, but physically he&rsquo;s doing so much better. He&rsquo;s a miracle in that respect and he&rsquo;s a miracle to our family.&rdquo;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Officials at Porter and University would not talk about the case because of privacy laws, only saying they cannot legally hold a patient who is not an imminent danger to himself or others. In other words, under Colorado law, if a person is not planning to kill himself or murder someone right now, that person does not fit the legal requirement for treatment.</p>
		<p>The Flemings considered sending their son to a private psychiatric treatment center, without doctor&rsquo;s orders and without insurance authorization. But it was $20,000 per month. Instead, they rescued him from the shelter and put him up in a hotel, then an apartment.</p>
		<p>He has Medicaid and now receives treatment at the Mental Health Center of Denver.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for our family. What is done is done,&rdquo; Fleming said. &ldquo;But this needs to change for other families.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Hours or days or never</h3>

		<p class="lead">Hospital emergency rooms are built to handle heart attacks and gunshot wounds. Not mental breakdowns.</p>
		<p>Yet they are filled with patients having panic attacks or suicidal thoughts. People seeking mental health treatment at the ER usually are sent away with phone numbers of local therapists. The wait to see a psychiatrist in this city is about five months long. Colorado has only 15 psychiatrists per 100,000 people, compared with 92 primary-care physicians.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stabilize a mental health crisis with a Band-Aid around the head,&rdquo; said Scott Glaser, executive director of the Colorado branch of the <a href="http://www.namicolorado.org/" title="National Alliance on Mental Illness website">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a>.</p>
		<p>At University Hospital, which closed its psychiatric department six years ago, about 750 people per month&mdash;or 10 percent of visitors to the emergency department&mdash;come for mental health reasons.</p>
		<p>Colorado law mandates that hospitals can&rsquo;t turn away someone who is suicidal, homicidal or so &ldquo;gravely disabled&rdquo; that they can&rsquo;t manage to take care of themselves by finding food or shelter. But most hospitals have no place&mdash;other than an ER bed&mdash;to treat a mental health patient. Hospitals keep them until they can find a psychiatric bed at another hospital or private treatment center.</p>
		<p>This can take hours. Or days. Or never. Colorado hospitals report fewer psychiatric hospital beds per capita than most states, according to American Hospital Association data.</p>
		<p>Hospitals here, including University and St. Anthony&rsquo;s, closed their psychiatric units because the units were losing money. One doctor called it an oxymoron to say &ldquo;moneymaking psychiatric department.&rdquo; The issue is that insurance companies reimburse hospitals at a higher rate for physical health care than mental health care.</p>
		<p>The number of psychiatric beds at Colorado&rsquo;s two state mental hospitals for patients whose care has been taken over by the state and those sent from state courts, in Pueblo and Denver, has slid from 611 a decade ago to about 550 today.</p>
		<p>Finding an open bed can feel like a scavenger hunt.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an order of magnitude more difficult in Colorado,&rdquo; said Dr. Rich Zane, chairman of emergency medicine at University of Colorado School of Medicine and who moved to Colorado two years ago from a hospital in Boston. &ldquo;An order of magnitude would be a conservative description.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Out of the 9,000 patients per year who come into University&rsquo;s ER with mental health issues, just fewer than 1,000 are placed on 72-hour holds by doctors. Some spend the entire hold in an ER exam room because no psychiatric bed was found.</p>
		<p>The majority of the 28,000 psychiatric holds in Colorado in 2012 were related to suicidal thoughts or attempts. More than 2,500 were people placed on more than one hold that year.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Mental health &ldquo;parity&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">The federal Affordable Care Act created &ldquo;parity&rdquo; for mental health care, requiring insurance companies to provide their customers the same coverage for mental health treatment as they do for other care. But the law does not affect negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies, said Ben Price, executive director of the Colorado Association of Health Plans.</p>
		<p>Hospital officials say that despite the law, they recoup less from private insurance companies for mental care than physical care. Denver Health, for example, is reimbursed for 32 percent of mental health billing compared with 41 percent for other medical care, according to the hospital&rsquo;s financial office. Other hospitals refused to disclose that data. Experts say it&rsquo;s too early to measure how the new health care law is increasing treatment for mental health patients. Community mental health clinics, however, are seeing an influx of new Medicaid patients.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty remarkable that insurance companies treat psychiatric care different than they treat all other care,&rdquo; Zane said. &ldquo;For some reason, brain failure is different than heart failure. That is one of the intrinsic prejudices against psychiatric insurance, and it&rsquo;s pervasive.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Insurance company executives said while it&rsquo;s true that psychiatric care generally is reimbursed at a lower rate than surgical care, rates negotiated between hospitals and insurance companies vary widely across medical specialities.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I do understand that we do have a psychiatric problem in this state,&rdquo; said Neil Waldron, chief marketing officer for Rocky Mountain Health Plans. &ldquo;But how we negotiate with the hospitals is a mutually agreed upon thing.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Denver Health Medical Center is one of the few hospitals that has psychiatric emergency services, a secure, nine-bed section separate from the main emergency department. The unit sees 3,800 patients each year, of which about 900 are admitted. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="startVideo" id="hilite1" onclick="playerScroller('video3', 'Q5b3JkcTpaLJDDENZwHn_zMBA1nyDsma', this);">Most come for evaluation</a> after police or ER doctors have placed them on mental health holds.</p>

		<p>Some patients are able to leave within hours, after family meetings and help dealing with their immediate stress. Others are sent to the 36-bed, long-term psychiatric unit, where the average stay is about seven days.</p>
		<p>Kim Nordstrom, the medical director of psychiatric emergency services, also has a law degree. Her professional degrees are at odds when she encounters a homeless person with mental illness who chooses to eat from the trash and sleep in the cold, yet has no signs of dehydration or malnutrition.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I would not want to live that way and we don&rsquo;t like to see other people live that way, but they have a right to,&rdquo; Nordstrom said. She can, however, hold a patient if the person&rsquo;s psychosis is interfering with the ability to make a plan to find food and shelter.</p>
		<p>The Medical Center of Aurora&mdash;which opened a 40-bed psychiatric unit in 2012, the first one to open in the metro area in 10 years&mdash;gets patients from as far as Pueblo and Wyoming. The unit is almost always filled to capacity, which it caps at 32 because there are not enough psychiatrists to staff a unit of 40 people.</p>
		<p>Nationally, psychiatrists are scarce, their numbers dwindling further as the profession becomes less lucrative than other specialities. In some rural parts of Colorado, there are none.</p>
		<p>For the past 10 years, Denver psychiatrist Randy Buzan&rsquo;s voice mail has said he is not accepting new patients. He already has 400. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m buried. I just don&rsquo;t have time for all these people,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Like many psychiatrists, Buzan does not take insurance and instead charges patients on a sliding scale because that&rsquo;s easier and more profitable than dealing with insurance companies. Buzan said he and some other psychiatrists avoid taking suicidal or homicidal patients because of the risks of a lawsuit if patients end up committing murder or killing themselves.</p>
		<p>The Medical Center of Aurora built its psychiatric unit as a &ldquo;community service&rdquo; because emergency rooms at all HealthONE hospitals in Colorado were warehousing patients in mental health crisis. Patients are not getting treatment before they reach crisis, and often not after leaving hospitals either, said Teresa Mayer, medical director of the psychiatric unit.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anywhere to send them. Imagine if you had appendicitis and there was nowhere to go for follow-up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible. What could have been prevented is not preventable when there is no one to care for them.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">George Brady has a thing for weed.</p>
		<p>It relaxes his mind, he says, so he smokes it even though the judge, his caseworker and his therapist keep telling him it&rsquo;s messing with his medication for schizoaffective disorder. He thinks it gives him clarity, but to everyone else, George seems more confused and forgetful when he is high.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Stay away from the marijuana,&rdquo; Judge Barajas is telling him for the 20th time at least. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a struggle for you, and especially the spice. Are we on the same page?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George, 28, sees the world through an altered reality, a haze so thick it is improved but not lifted by his monthly medication shot. He hasn&rsquo;t hurt anyone but has been to jail 36 times, usually for what he terms misunderstandings. His most recent arrest was for loitering too long at a truckstop Wendy&rsquo;s. Then he was stripped of his bus pass last summer because an agent caught him trying to sell &mdash; George says give &mdash; a bus voucher to another rider.</p>
		<p>He continued to ride anyway, because how else would he get from the motel in the shadow of Interstate 70 east of Denver to his court-ordered therapy appointments downtown?</p>

		<p>It happens all the time, this total disconnect between two systems. The courts are paying for George to get therapy and stay out of jail, while the city transportation system is taking away the bus pass he uses to get to therapy.</p>
		<p>George did not realize as it was happening that he was losing his bus pass; he figures it out in court several days later. He is wide-eyed, eyebrows raised, head cocked, giving the judge one of his signature dumbfounded looks. &ldquo;RTD is everywhere! That means I can&rsquo;t be nowhere!&rdquo; he says.</p>

		<p>George is tall and softspoken. He wears his pants baggy, still with the store tags, and lets his hair grow until it is sticking up. He says he doesn&rsquo;t know what schizoaffective disorder &mdash; a combination of schizophrenia and mood disorder that alters his perception of reality &mdash; is, really. What he has, he says, is &ldquo;hard times.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I hear imaginary voices or see imaginary people,&rdquo; he says, sitting on his motel room bed, snacking on sunflower seeds and chuckling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been feeling a lot better. I&rsquo;ve been getting rest. I&rsquo;ve been eating. I&rsquo;ve been exercising, playing basketball. I feel a lot better.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He&rsquo;s taking Trazadone to help him sleep and a monthly shot of Invega &ldquo;to be clearing my thoughts,&rdquo; George said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George, like the others, came to Court to Community because the jail nurse and other staff noticed his frequent trips to jail were connected to the state of his mental health. The majority of those in the program are charged with shoplifting, trespassing, prostitution and disturbing the peace.</p>
		<p>Defendants sent to Court to Community spend 49 percent fewer days in jail after entering the program, yet 205 percent more days in the hospital for psychiatric care. Annual cost savings come out to $1,342 per person, according to the program&rsquo;s analysis.</p>

		<p>The good news though, says program director Eric Smith at the Mental Health Center of Denver, is that more hospital time typically means defendants are improving their mental health. And <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="startVideo" id="hilite2" onclick="playerScroller('video9', 'cyc3NkcTp-FYZXrWwYYYVXT4npIbmNrZ', this);">hospitalization costs level out</a> after the initial spike caused by participation in Court to Community, according to the mental health center&rsquo;s research.</p>
		<p>George&rsquo;s life was cruising along until a year into college in New Mexico, where he was studying pharmacy. His mental health deteriorated to the point he couldn&rsquo;t focus in class and dropped out, returning to Colorado. In the last six years, he has had numerous jobs, none for long. He has been homeless several times. But George is laid-back and sunny, sticking to his daily routine of checking in with his court-assigned caseworker, who manages his federal disability check.</p>
		<p>In court, George picks fruit snacks and a candy bar from the treat basket and sits down to wait for his friend Marcus; they knew each other at East High School and reconnected in Court to Community. Marcus has to produce an essay on the dangers of PCP for the judge.</p>
		<p>If George can stay out of trouble, he will graduate from the program and get off probation this month.</p>

		<p>She never wants to return to jail. She says she is done with booze. She says she is done with her ex, also an alcoholic. Until the day she runs into him as he is being released from jail and she is heading into Thursday court.</p>

		<p class="insetquote">&ldquo;Hello? Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home?&rdquo; <span>&mdash; Pink Floyd, Courtroom 3H</span></p>

		<p class="lead">No one is cured of mental illness, or the closely connected substance abuse, at Court to Community.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They are not curable diseases, but we are putting them in remission,&rdquo; said Shari Lewinski, program administrator for Denver&rsquo;s behavioral health courts. &ldquo;When we first meet them, they are lost, they are confused, unkempt, angry, bitter.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That is the most horrendous, cruelest aspect of mental illness &mdash; that it is a brain disease. Any other illness, you wouldn&rsquo;t argue with the doctor about what the treatment is. Your behavior is what is impacted by mental health, and people pass judgment on that.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Lewinski is notified when the jail or a judge finds someone they suspect is a good fit for Court to Community, which began eight years ago and was modeled after drug court programs that treat the root cause of drug-related crimes &mdash; addiction. The program was started by a former judge alarmed by seeing so many repeat defendants with mental illness in his courtroom.</p>
		<p>Inmates in the program are pushed to the front of the line for psychiatric services at the Mental Health Center of Denver or the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, but the wait to see a psychiatrist can still take months.</p>
		<p>Judge Barajas&rsquo; compassion for the mentally ill stems in part from his uncle, who was hit in the skull with a can opener when he was a boy. He was left with permanent brain damage that kept him in and out of the New Mexico state mental hospital much of his life.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Instead of the state hospitals, we have the county jail,&rdquo; Barajas said.</p>
		<p>His biggest challenge is convincing defendants to take their medication. The music, snacks, chit-chat and honor roll are meant to make his courtroom feel relaxed and tolerant. Court staff and defendants sing happy birthday to each other, applaud for a week of fulfilled commitments. Defendants beam when the judge ups their grades or puts them on the honor roll, which means they are called to the podium first and get to leave court sooner.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I doubt any of these folks got those grades in school,&rdquo; Barajas said.</p>
		<p>Darcy McCarthy&rsquo;s grade is raised nearly every week. The judge is in awe of her progress.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;She was disheveled. She talked a mile a minute. She didn&rsquo;t have any organized thought process,&rdquo; he says of the Darcy who walked into court last spring. &ldquo;Look at her now. It&rsquo;s night and day. It&rsquo;s just a completely different human being.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">George wants to know if he has enough money left to buy a glittering faux-diamond necklace with &ldquo;Dope&rdquo; spelled in rhinestones.</p>
		<p>He already picked out a $36 pair of hiking boots, an orange-and-black sweatshirt and a &ldquo;ragtop&rdquo; shirt with a cheetah.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If you dress nice, you feel nice, so I can&rsquo;t wait to get dressed,&rdquo; he says, ducking into a dressing room at the Gen-X store on Colfax. His mental health case manager is helping him spend his disability money, making sure he has enough left for food and rent. He buys the necklace but does not wear it to court.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You are a smart guy,&rdquo; Lewinski tells him in court. &ldquo;I like the George who stays out of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George has moved into an apartment and wants to start nursing classes at Emily Griffith Opportunity School. He spent a court-ordered night in jail because he can&rsquo;t stay away from marijuana. &ldquo;I got to try harder. Buckle down. Watch my surroundings,&rdquo; he says.</p>
		<p>He wasn&rsquo;t allowed to graduate on time, held back because his drug tests keep coming up positive for weed.</p>
		<p>Darcy McCarthy&rsquo;s attempts to stay sober and make it to her psychiatric appointments fell apart soon after her ex walked back into her life. After seven months without trouble, she was arrested in October after drinking and fighting with a stranger on a bus.</p>
		<p>Christopher White, who grew up in Hotchkiss and flunked out of school in fifth grade, was arrested soon after he was dismissed from the program. He spent three months in jail, in a solitary cell in the mental health unit, for trespassing again near the 16th Street Mall.</p>
		<p>During a jailhouse interview halfway through that sentence, and after about a month back on medication, Christopher talked of cracking codes of the &ldquo;purple people&rdquo; and the importance of reporting the codes to the anti-Christ who lives in an alley off Pennsylvania Street east of downtown. &ldquo;The purple people, they don&rsquo;t believe in Christ Jesus the King,&rdquo; he said, explaining that when he writes the codes, Jesus takes over his pen.</p>
		<p>He was upset his release date was Oct. 31.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared because it&rsquo;s the day of the dead,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Judge Barajas&rsquo; rotation as the head of Court to Community ended this fall, but he has kept in touch with several of his offenders, often through jail visits.</p>

			<p class="lead">At dawn, the shelters send them back to the streets. Or they wake up beside the river, another day to wander downtown among the workers and tourists.</p>
			<p>Two-thirds of them, the chronically homeless of Denver, have this in common: mental illness.</p>
			<p>Just one-third of those with mental illnesses are receiving treatment, based on national estimates.</p>
			<p>The causes of homelessness &mdash; job loss, family breakups, alcohol and drug abuse &mdash; often are rooted in mental illness, and treatment of mental health problems becomes even more difficult without a stable home.</p>
			<p>Housing is health care, the best form of treatment for those with mental illness living on the streets. Yet Denver has a shortage of affordable housing, leaving nonprofits and government agencies to offer a patchwork of psychiatric services to the homeless that barely reaches beyond the most severe cases.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;All of these things work together to create a feeder system into homelessness,&rdquo; said John Parvensky, president of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. &ldquo;Once people are on the streets, their mental health issues intensify. What might be mild anxiety becomes more significant anxiety. Depression certainly intensifies as well.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The need is far greater than nonprofits and government clinics can handle.</p>
			<p>The coalition&rsquo;s mental health clinic kept a waiting list for new patients until a few years ago. The staff threw it out when it reached 2,000 names.</p>
			<p>It was not &ldquo;kind, useful or ethical&rdquo; to tell people what number they were, and by the time someone on the wait list was up for an appointment, it usually was impossible to find them again, said psychiatric director Dr. Elizabeth Cookson. Now the psychiatric team accepts patients mostly through referrals from the coalition&rsquo;s primary-care staff. An unknown number are turned away when the clinic is full.</p>
			<p>The coalition has capped its waiting list for housing at 100 names, a dent in the thousands of homeless in the Denver metro area. There are now hundreds of people waiting, for months or years.</p>

		<p class="lead">&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t none of us got here by taxi,&rdquo; say Arlin Kelly, one of 25 women who live at Irving Street Women&rsquo;s Residence, a Volunteers of America home for chronically homeless women with mental illness.</p>
		<p>The average stay at the Denver house &mdash; which has rocking chairs on the front porch and three meals a day &mdash; is about two years, long enough for most women to become mentally stable and find their own apartments.</p>
		<p>Irving Street residents receive treatment through mental health clinics, and therapists visit the house. About 60 percent of the women leave successful.</p>
		<p>For most, it is the first home they&rsquo;ve had in years without a time limit, without curfews or stringent rules, a place full of second chances.</p>
		<p>The women who live in the renovated dorm-style home, a couple of blocks from Federal Boulevard, pay 30 percent of their income, which for some is nothing. Many receive federal disability checks, typically about $700 or so per month.</p>
		<p>The home receives most of its funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Federal policymakers have elected not to open any other safe havens, instead putting money toward subsidized housing options for individuals and families.</p>
		<p>The wait list to move into Irving Street is months long. The goal is that the women get therapy, gain mental stability and find their own apartments.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been through so many more things than any of us can imagine,&rdquo; said Angel Hurtado, associate division director for housing support services. &ldquo;It gives them time to focus on what caused homelessness in the first place. They have been victims, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to stay victims.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>For these women, two years is a luxury.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Two years feels like a lifetime after what we&rsquo;ve been through,&rdquo; says Kelly, waiting to go inside for a communal dinner of meatloaf, beans, corn bread, carrots and spinach.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;By the time we got here, we were so ground down by mental illness, by surviving one day after the next, the same horror show,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This place, this is like landing in Candyland. I wake up every morning and I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Evolving science</h3>

		<p class="lead">Diagnosis of mental illness in children has advanced significantly in the last 20 years, but what is lacking is &ldquo;knowing what works and what helps,&rdquo; said Lydia Prado, head of child and family services at the Mental Health Center of Denver.</p>
		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the late 1980s that the medical world definitively acknowledged children could get depressed. Prior thinking was that children had not developed enough emotionally to suffer depression. The field of children&rsquo;s psychiatry has evolved to recognize that depression looks different in children than it does in adults.</p>
		<p>Even babies can become depressed, said Dr. Shannon Bekman, program manager for the infant mental health program at the Mental Health Center of Denver.</p>
		<p>Babies are supposed to cry. It&rsquo;s when they stop crying &mdash; often because of neglect &mdash; that they are considered clinically depressed.</p>
		<p>Scientists have found that a huge portion of brain development happens in the first three years of life, so treatment then has lifelong impact, Bekman said. Therapy for depressed babies focuses on strengthening the parent-childhood relationship.</p>
		<p>Some children develop a mental illness because of a one-time traumatic experience such as a car accident. One child treated at the Mental Health Center of Denver was riding in a Toyota Prius that was struck head-on by a tractor-trailer rig. The preschooler became withdrawn, regressed in toilet training, and refused to set foot in a vehicle. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
		<p>Another child would break down when it was time to clean up. It turned out that a caregiver had been telling the 4-year-old a goblin would get her if she was bad.</p>
		<p>The symptoms of mental illness in younger children typically are setbacks in language or developmental skills, including walking or crawling. Mental illness in school-age children often looks like anger and aggression, although girls are more likely to internalize it and appear sad and shy.</p>
		<p>The Mental Health Center of Denver has therapists in several Denver schools and public health clinics so that kids can get psychiatric care at the same place they see pediatricians. The center also sends therapists to day-care centers and runs a day-treatment program for kids whose mental illness is so severe that it keeps them from functioning in regular classrooms.</p>
		<p>Denver Public Schools has infused its mental health services with $4.5 million in additional spending spread over three years, on top of the $12.2 million annual budget for psychological and social work. Every school in the district has either a psychologist, social worker or both, and mental health staff has increased 30 percent in five years.</p>
		<p>The boost in services targeted neighborhoods where children have suffered the most trauma and are more likely to have emotional problems at school, said Eldridge Greer, director of social emotional learning for Denver schools.</p>
		<p>At 15 school-based clinics last year, more than 1,500 Denver students received 12,000 mental health therapy sessions.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t look at it through the mental health lens, it may be seen as a discipline problem,&rdquo; Greer said. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t address mental health, we are not going to get the results we want in academics.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Anger management</h3>

		<p class="lead">This is how Chazz Worrell, 10, explains his depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and intermittent explosive disorder:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When people be mean to me, it makes me get really angry, so I have to let it all out somewhere,&rdquo; he said. He feels like he wants to hit somebody. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t do that. What I do is hit wood. It helps keep the pressure on the inside instead of letting it all out on other people.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He chops wood, builds fences, moves horses and bottle-feeds the calves at his older brother&rsquo;s small ranch in Fort Collins.</p>

		<p>The fourth-grader spends time at the ranch almost daily, and his mother says it helps him more than any other therapy. Without some release, his emotional outbursts are volatile.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He can hit things, throw things, try to break things or even hit himself,&rdquo; Liz Worrell said. The anger gives way to sadness, especially if he hurt someone or broke something. He begins to yell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stupid! I shouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Chazz&rsquo;s anxiety has him constantly worried in public that he will get lost and never see his parents again. They are buying walkie-talkies. His post-traumatic stress developed after his grandmother passed away in front of him.</p>

Chazz was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He also has anxiety and anger issues. Their mother, Liz Worrell, says that Cody understands his younger brother. &ldquo;Cody has had a rough road and been down some of the same paths.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<p>Liz has been through this before, with her now-23-year-old son, and this time, she is much more equipped to handle the school meetings that felt, the first time around, like board rooms where she was on trial for her parenting skills. Now, she brings Chazz&rsquo;s advocate from a community mental health clinic.</p>
		<p>By now, she also has shunned medication, tired of seeing her older son playing the &ldquo;guinea pig&rdquo; as doctors adjusted medications that made him sit around all day like a zombie. Instead, she gives Chazz a quiet room, with his dog, to calm down. Afterward, they talk about how he could have handled his outburst another way.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;By the time they are done here, they are worn out. The best therapy I can give them is this,&rdquo; said Liz, surrounded by calves, alpacas and horses.</p>
