		<p class="lead">In 2014, Colorado realized just how close (Broncos and Avalanche) and just how far away (Rockies and Nuggets) it was to glory. But what made 2014 a fascinating year in sports was that very little happened as we thought it would. And that&rsquo;s what makes us fanatical about sports.</p>
		<p>We thought, for instance, the Broncos would steamroll through the playoffs, but it was the Broncos who were embarrassed in the Super Bowl.</p>
		<p>We thought the Avs would be an adorable story of budding stars cracking the postseason. But suddenly, they won the division and were talking title &#8230; only to get ousted in the first round.</p>
		<p>We thought Rockies owner Dick Monfort would keep Dan O&rsquo;Dowd in charge until 3014, but Dan finally resigned and Monfort promoted Jeff Bridich to general manager.</p>
		<p>And we thought the Colorado State Rams would maybe win seven football games, but they won 10 in the regular season &#8212; and little CSU made national news when Florida swiped its coach.</p>

	<div class="large-9 large-centered medium-11 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p>Unlike baseball, football&rsquo;s season isn&rsquo;t neatly placed into the baking pan that is a calendar year. As such, the last NFL season spilled into 2014. In the playoffs, the Broncos and Peyton Manning sent Philip Rivers back to San Diego with his silly tie, and Denver later sent Tom Brady back to Boston with his silly boots.</p>
		<p>But from the moment Manny Ramirez sent the opening snap to Hackensack, the Super Bowl seemed doomed. Forty-three. Eight.</p>
		<p>Still stings, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
		<p>But John Elway approached free agency with the urgency of <a href="http://youtu.be/q36SIc5h6AM">The Drive</a>, yes sir. You know the story: DeMarcus Ware, T.J. Ward, Aqib Talib, an investment in nasty. And by December, Denver had one of the NFL&rsquo;s formidable defenses. Oh, and after the offensive line faced <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/lunchspecial/ci_26969113/stink-knows-mark-schlereth-says-broncos-o-line">the wrath of Mark Schlereth</a>, the Broncos&rsquo; offense looked 1998-y, with <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_27064040/peyton-manning-takes-back-seat-c-j-anderson-shines-broncos">a run game</a> complementing a legendary gunslinger.</p>
		<p>The Avs still don&rsquo;t get enough credit for a mesmerizing turnaround. Worst in the Western Conference in 2012-13, they finished second in the conference in 2013-14. Saved by Roy, as they say. Saint Patrick became Coach Patrick, and he made believers out of these kids. Nathan MacKinnon even got Wayne Gretzky&rsquo;s approval.</p>
		<p>But reality soon sunk in. The Avs were winning despite a disproportionate number of shots by other teams. In other words, Semyon Varlamov was keeping them in games by playing like his coach. And by the fall, the Avs were back to being average.</p>
		<p>The Rockies stunk, again. Troy Tulowitzki got hurt, again. Carlos Gonzalez got hurt, again. The bullpen blew saves, again. Dinger annoyed everyone, again. And even though some aging vet (Justin Morneau) won the Rockies a batting title, again, the team was basically baseball&rsquo;s version of the Columbus Blue Jackets (again).</p>
		<p>The Nugs? Ugh. The Denver Nuggets stunk all of 2014. The team had numerous nice complementary pieces but hardly a nucleus to win in the playoffs &mdash; or even <i>make</i> the playoffs. As 2014 ends, one wonders who will still be with the Nuggets at this time next year.</p>
		<p>In Boulder, Colorado hoops showed promise. Colorado football, meanwhile, barely showed up, going winless in the Pac-12 conference. And there&rsquo;s much excitement in Fort Collins, with both sports, but questions about the football team sustaining success &mdash; in 2015 but also 2017, when the Rams&rsquo; new on-campus stadium is slated to open. And Air Force just kept winning, actually defeating CSU&rsquo;s football team in <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/colleges/ci_27030740/air-force-beats-csu-last-second-fg-end">a marquee matchup</a>.</p>
		<p>In 2014, we said hello to Emmanuel Sanders and Bradley Roby, Jarome Iginla and Eddie Butler, Dee Hart and Arron Afflalo, again.</p>
		<p>And in 2014, we said goodbye to Eric Decker and Knowshon Moreno, Paul Stastny and Spencer Dinwiddie, Evan &ldquo;More Champagne Mister&rdquo; Fournier and the great Roland Bailey.</p>
		<p>He didn&rsquo;t end his career as one, but he&rsquo;ll always be Champ.</p>

		<p>When Pat Bowlen <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_26199148/pat-bowlen-resigns-control-denver-broncos-acknowledges-dealing-alzheimers-disease">announced through the Denver Post</a> in July that he would step down as Broncos owner after 30 seasons because of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, it was Ellis who was put in charge. Ellis is now the Broncos&rsquo; chief executive officer as well as president, which means he has the final say on all team matters. Ellis is also in charge of the Pat Bowlen Trust, which states one of Bowlen&rsquo;s seven children will eventually run the team.</p>

		<p>More than the mayor, more than the governor, the local &rsquo;s quarterback is the face of the city. Jay Cutler never did get it. Manning has always understood his responsibility beyond the field. He represents Denver well. More importantly, he lends civic pride and hope that the Broncos will win it all.</p>

        <p>Think back to September, when the second video of Ray Rice had come out, the one of him striking his then fianc&eacute;e in a casino elevator. Rice had earlier been handed a two-game suspension for the incident, but the latest evidence that was made public was too much for many &#8212; including Knighton, the Broncos&rsquo; defensive tackle &#8212; to bear. So Knighton said something. He said something bold and he said it at a time when many with fame and money still choose to steer clear of contentious social issues. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a damn who u are or how much money you make,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/08/terrance-knighton-ray-rice-tweets/29292/">he tweeted</a>. &ldquo;No place for this. As players we always speak on how we are unfairly treated, well now what?&rdquo; Knighton has also spoken out on the <a href="https://twitter.com/MrKnighton2u/status/537069201140486145">Darren Wilson trial</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MrKnighton2u/status/540324093782798336">Eric Garner</a> case.

		<p>The Rockies <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_26685903/dan-odowd-bill-geivett-resign-from-colorado-rockies">promoted Bridich</a>, their director of baseball operations since 2005, to general manager on Oct. 8. It was a sea change for the notoriously staid Colorado front office. Bridich replaced Dan O&rsquo;Dowd after his 15 years in power, in which the Rockies played in just two postseasons. But Bridich also effectively replaced assistant GM Bill Geivett. Bridich&rsquo;s consolidation of power wields a heavy influence on the Rockies, but his biggest task &#8212; bigger than dealing with Troy Tulowitzki trade rumors and scraping the barrel for pitching &#8212; will be carving out some autonomy in the front office and proving himself on his own. The Rockies often talk about collaboration in their front office. And that&rsquo;s nice &#8212; especially between Bridich and manager Walt Weiss. But it&rsquo;s counterproductive to have someone above him making the decisions.</p>

		<p>The Manimal made his mark on the court with a stellar end to last season, which faded into a national headline-making stint with USA Basketball. He won a gold medal, was named to the FIBA World Cup all-tournament team and then turned his NBA and international success into a four-year, &#36;50 million contract extension. And all of this one year after he won the NBA’s monthly Kia Community Assist Award for his philanthropic contributions, as well as the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award for his "outstanding service and dedication to the community." Those things haven’t stopped as Faried has continued to work toward the ideal of equality, tolerance and inclusion.</p>

       <p>The Denver Nuggets of late have not been a championship-caliber team. Sure, they’ve had some recent teams that showed promise -- ones that had stars, ones that had depth, ones that were well-coached. But no recent teams that were ready to win it all. And the 2014 season -- after a 36-win campaign in 2013 -- is no different. What does set the Nuggets apart, though, is Rocky. He’s the champion of mascots. <a href="http://www.nba.com/nuggets/rocky-most-awesome-mascot">He’s a Hall of Famer</a>. He’s the reason many fans still go to Nuggets games. And yes, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2014/ci_26636060/nuggets-mascot-rocky-surprises-bosses-gop-rally-appearance">he has a tendency to go rogue</a>, but let’s be honest: It takes one heck of a mascot to have its off-the-court activities worthy of headlines. Take notes, Dinger.</p>

		<p>The legendary former Avs goalie and Hockey Hall of Famer returned to coach the team to the playoffs for the first time since 2010, helping them go from 29th overall in the NHL to third his first season on the job while accumulating 112 regular-season points.</p>

	        </div>
	    </div>
		<p>The first overall pick of the 2013 NHL draft, MacKinnnon led all rookies with 63 points in the 2013-14 regular season and was the runaway winner for the Calder Trophy, given to the league’s best rookie. He was the youngest ever to win the award, coming in at only 18 years and 224 days at the close of the season.</p>
        <div class="row">

	        </div>
	    </div>
		<p>In his third season on the job, McElwain guided Colorado State to a stunningly successful season (10-2), despite <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/colleges/ci_27030740/air-force-beats-csu-last-second-fg-end">a disappointing loss to Air Force</a> that ended the Rams’ regular season. He did it with a savvy and pragmatic embrace of the core holdover players from the Steve Fairchild era &#8212; including quarterback Garrett Grayson, tackle Ty Sambrailo and linebackers Aaron Davis and Max Morgan &#8212; and adding talent behind them. Plus, his staff was an invigorating mix of veterans and young coaches, and it got the most out of the Rams. Now he’s in Gainesville to see if he can do the same for the Florida Gators.</p>

		<p>Despite being only 18, the EagleVail skier was supposed to win the slalom at the Sochi Olympics. She was the reigning world champion and had dominated World Cup slalom for two seasons. Being the heavy favorite could have been too heavy a burden for some, but Shiffrin came through, showing America what fans of ski racing in Colorado have known for more than two years now: Shiffrin is a special athlete with a sparkling personality and a brilliant future.</p>

		<p>The Wheat Ridge sophomore lives for softball. In the 4A state quarterfinal, she cranked a walk-off double in the bottom of the seventh to power the Farmers into the next round. <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/hochman/ci_26751286/dear-gabby-keeps-smiling">Loya’s performance is truly a comeback story</a>. Diagnosed with leukemia the summer before her freshman year of high school, she battled the disease while never giving up her dream of returning to the diamond. With her leukemia in remission, Loya returned to the field in full form, winning the Jeffco 4A Player of the Year award.</p>

		<p>When Oscar Pareja bolted for Dallas last offseason, the Rapids handed the keys of a playoff-caliber team to club legend Mastroeni. Just months removed from retiring as a player, Mastroeni brought a thoughtful, philosophical approach to Commerce City, preaching hard work, teamwork and a de-emphasis on results. Early on it looked like a masterstroke by the Rapids’ front office, but injuries and a lack of defensive depth helped to spoil Mastroeni’s first season. His unorthodoxed lineup decisions fueled his critics, and the Rapids slogged through a 14-game winless streak to miss the playoffs. For better or worse, Mastroeni was the most influential figure in Colorado soccer in 2014.</p>

Manning entered needing only two touchdown passes to tie Brett Favre’s mark of 508, which Manning got in the first quarter with a 3-yard completion to Emmanuel Sanders and a 20-yard catch-and-run by Wes Welker. The record-setting <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/10/21/watch-peyton-manning-micd-record-touchdown-509/30484/">509th career Touchdown pass</a> fittingly went to top receiver Demaryius Thomas on an 8-yard pass near the right pylon late in the first half. The Broncos receivers then used the historic ball as a prop in a keep-away game from Manning, a celebration that was staged during a Friday practice by Manning himself. He finished the game with 510 in the books.

It was Colorado's first complete game in Denver since 2011. Matzek's debut year hinted at his potential, but his ups and downs should have been expected. He'll need to improve going into 2015, but he's a key young piece in the Rockies’ rotation. Problem is, they need three Matzeks, or more. If he can work his way to the top of the rotation, though, it could go a long way to making the Rockies more competitive.

That the Giants went on to win the World Series and the Rockies lost 96 games is an important illustration. The Rockies showed great promise, but seasons aren’t won in June.

Two minutes after going up a man, Rapids midfielder Jose Mari hit a long-range, physics-bending strike that pinged off the inside of the far post for the equalizer. Two minutes later, Mari capped off the comeback with a right-footed bender from just outside the penalty area.

And then, on Nov. 2, &#8230; <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_26851704/denver-broncos-lose-new-england-patriots-43-21">same ol’, same ol’</a>. Tom Brady threw for 333 yards and four touchdowns on a frigid night and the Pats rolled the Broncos, 43-21, for the third time in three years in Foxborough.

		<p>In July, Rockies owner Dick Monfort <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_26132113/rockies-owner-dick-monfort-issues-formal-apology-fans-offended">sent a series of cranky emails</a> to fans. Some of them read, "Denver doesn't deserve a franchise," and, "If product and experience that bad don't come!" Monfort's frustration was showing. But fans, giddy for a chance to show how much more frustrated they were than the owner, jumped on the pile. If there's one takeaway from the weird ordeal, it's this: Monfort, perhaps, needs to delegate some duties. Let Bridich do his thing as GM. And maybe auto-reply for emails.

		<p>A 28-year-old minor-leaguer since 2005, Yohan Flande finally hit the bigs for the Rockies. He <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_26035613/rockies-yohan-flande-battles-major-league-debut-vs">debuted against the Cardinals’ Marco Gonzales</a>, just 22, on June 25. Flande’s start didn’t go well and he was middling the rest of the way. But it’s the big picture that’s the problem. Flande replaced Christian Bergman in the Rockies’ rotation, and Bergman made his big-league debut only as an injury replacement. Flande was the Rockies’ 12th starter &#8212; the most in the majors at the time &#8212; and they went on to use 15 during the season. They cycled in starters like they were on clearance. And, by extension, the Rockies gutted their Triple-A stock.

		<p>The Broncos spent the offseason reshaping their roster because of unfinished business; a magical 2013 season ended with a thud and a punch to the windpipe from the Seattle Seahawks. The Broncos now have a puncher's chance that didn't exist before the loss at St. Louis. If this team's biggest concern is Peyton Manning's arm strength, that's a much better position to be in than wondering if the Broncos can figure out their running game, offensive line and special teams in Game 16. A third franchise Super Bowl title in Manning's third season in Denver? It's the most popular wish in Denver.

		<p>Maybe we became spoiled in just two years but ... can you imagine Colorado sports without Manning?! It will soon be a reality, we know, but we’re hoping not for at least another year, maybe two. Since his Denver arrival in 2012, Manning has revived the Broncos and restored fans’ faith in the Orange and Blue. And in coming off a 36-win Nuggets season, a 66-win Rockies season, another lost year for CU football, the recent departure of CSU’s Jim McElwain, the second-worst Rapids season ever and an injury-riddled start to the Avs season, we’re begging you, Peyton: Don’t call it quits just yet. Give it another year. Better yet: Finish out your contract.</p>

		<p>The Rockies, somewhat surprisingly, declined Brett Anderson&rsquo;s &#36;12 million contract option for the 2015 season. It was a steep cost for an oft-injured pitcher. But he&rsquo;s a proven, talented starter, and the Rockies don’t have many of those. So add one more spot to fill. The Rockies&rsquo; rotation for 2015, for now, looks like&#58; Jorge De La Rosa at No. 1, then, in no order, Jordan Lyles, Tyler Matzek and Jhoulys Chacin (if healthy). That’s about it. Plus, maybe, Flande and Bergman. Yikes.

		<p>Seriously, they need more pitching. They REALLY need more pitching. Franklin Morales’ 22 starts last season were the second-most among Rockies pitchers. And he wasn’t even a starter. The Rockies could really use Eddie Butler and Jon Gray &#8212; but only if they prove in spring training they’re ready for the bigs. Even if they do, the Rockies need one or two more reliable starting pitchers. Better believe Bridich will press hard on the free-agent and trade markets, looking for more arms.

		<p>When Timofey Mozgov landed in Denver as part of the blockbuster Carmelo Anthony trade in 2011, he was shelved as somewhat of an afterthought. Sure he was big -- 7-foot-1 big. But he would soon be a backup to a $44 million man in JaVale McGee. But when George Karl was fired in 2013 and Nuggets players went down like dominoes, Mozgov stepped in, playing all 82 games last season and showing glimpses of what could be. Remember that 23-point, 29-rebounding outing in a one-point win over the Warriors on April 10? Other teams (hi, Cavs) do. But here's hoping the Nuggets don't let him go. And here's hoping he gives us <a href="https://twitter.com/denvernuggets/status/517490527269163009">more of this</a>.</p>

As of now, the new stadium is tentatively slated to be ready for the 2017 season.

After spotting Alabama a 20-point first-quarter lead, CU played well. The Buffs lost, 30-24. To become bowl eligible in 2015, Colorado must show a huge improvement. But CU fans can be encouraged by all the close games against Pac-12 teams in 2014 (including double-overtime losses to California and UCLA) with a Buffs lineup filled with sophomores.

		<p>Beaver Creek has hosted the World Ski Championships twice before, but never with two hometown favorites being strong medal contenders. Here's hoping Lindsey Vonn can come back from the knee injury that kept her out of the Sochi Olympics and win medals in downhill and super-G, and that Mikaela Shiffrin can win multiple medals on a mountain four miles from her home. It would be great to see Ted Ligety defend his gold medal in giant slalom, and to see 37-year-old Bode Miller be the king of the mountain one more time. February will be interesting.
