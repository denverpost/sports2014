		<p class="lead">Ana Watson looks across the living room of the Colorado Springs house that still doesn&rsquo;t feel quite like home and sees her son, Preston, sitting stiffly on a brand-new couch. His eyelids flutter, struggling against the seizures that have quaked through his brain every day since he was 3 months old.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We have a special squirt-squirt we need to do, OK?&rdquo; Ana tells Preston, adopting a smile as she walks toward him. &ldquo;You need to be a big boy.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>In her hand, Ana holds the first dose of what she hopes will finally stop the seizures. More than a dozen medicines have already failed, and continuing down the certain path of conventional treatments promises only more misery and maybe even death for Preston. So Ana has chosen uncertainty in the form of this amber <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A marijuana extract rich in cannabinoids. Made by dissolving the cannabinoids from marijuana buds and leaves, then diluting the resulting slurry in cooking oil. CBD is generally given to kids in Colorado as an oil.">oil</span> created in a Boulder County garage.</p>
		<p>Just to get to this moment in July, she had to uproot her family and move across the country from North Carolina to Colorado, one of the few places where the new and unregulated treatment is at least somewhat legal. She&rsquo;s committing a federal crime just for trying.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Open up,&rdquo; Ana coos.</p>
		<p>Instead, Preston turns his head side to side to avoid the dropper. Squirming on the couch next to his mother, he&rsquo;s nearly as tall as she is. But hundreds of seizures a day have restrained his development to that of a 2-year-old. He is 12 years old, yet in many ways he&rsquo;s a 70-pound toddler.</p>
		<p>Ana grabs his arm, but he pushes her back. She tackles him and squirts the oil into his mouth, but he coughs it back up. She reaches for her cellphone.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Help,&rdquo; Ana writes in a Facebook message to the community of parents who have tried the same treatment. &ldquo;He is spitting it out and gagging. Can I mix it with food, give rectal? Any suggestions?????&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ana&rsquo;s mom, Milly, stirs more medicine into ice cream and brings it over. But Preston won&rsquo;t eat.</p>
		<p>Ana bribes him with his favorite YouTube videos &mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll press play if you take a bite.&rdquo; He still refuses.</p>
		<p>She promises him that his little sister, Sydney, will dance if he takes his medicine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing it,&rdquo; Sydney says.</p>
		<p>Ana&rsquo;s shoulders slump, and Milly tells her to back off.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re overdoing it,&rdquo; Milly admonishes. &ldquo;Skipping it is not going to hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But Ana&rsquo;s jaw clenches.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Why did we even come down here if he&rsquo;s not going to take it!?&rdquo; she snaps.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t force him to take it!&rdquo; Milly shouts.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He needs to learn to take it!&rdquo; Ana says.</p>
		<p>Milly walks out of the room, saying they should try later.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Stop arguing with me!&rdquo; Ana finally says. &ldquo;Damn.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She turns toward Preston, and, as if he senses the tension, the cringe on his face pivots into an awkward smile. He starts to laugh, and she does, too.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Silly mommy,&rdquo; he says quietly.</p>
		<p>Ana eventually calls a friend, who suggests giving the medicine in emptied pill capsules delivered as a suppository. She grimaces. But she has already been at it for an hour. The odds that seizures will kill Preston increase every year; the damage in his brain may soon be permanent. She is compelled to try.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Ana says as she fills the capsules. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be pretty.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>This time, she walks to him without a smile. She leads him into the bathroom and pulls down his diaper. She muscles him close.</p>
		<p>Preston squeals. Once. Then again.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Ana pleads. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>His cries fade to whimpers. His eyelids twitch with another seizure. Ana sits on the toilet, holding him on her lap as he quivers in her arms.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; she whispers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK, Boo-Boo.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Seven months and 1,600 miles after their journey began, Ana has finally given Preston his first dose of marijuana.</p>

		<p class="lead"><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="Marijuana grown and sold in Colorado under special regulations and intended for people suffering specified debilitating medical conditions. Colorado voters legalized medical marijuana in 2000 with the passage of Amendment 20.">Medical marijuana</span> has made Colorado a promised land for desperate parents trying to save their children.</p>
		<p>Children have arrived here nearly lifeless. Families have lived out of motels when they couldn&rsquo;t find housing. Parents have shown up at a medical marijuana provider&rsquo;s house in the middle of the night.</p>
		<p>At least two children and one woman across the country have died while their families prepared to move to Colorado for medical marijuana. One child who made it here died when the treatment didn&rsquo;t help her condition enough. Her mother moved back home alone.</p>
		<p>But no one knows more than anecdotes because Colorado does not track how many families come to treat their children with medical marijuana &mdash; although it&rsquo;s in the low hundreds &mdash; or where they go.</p>
		<p>No agency thoroughly regulates the treatment providers, beyond basic licensing. No rules govern the right formulation or dosage of the marijuana extract at the core of the treatment. No studies conclusively document the side effects.</p>
		<p>Most important, no one knows how often it works.</p>
		<p>A handful of organizations have sprouted in the past couple of years to offer support to parents moving to Colorado and those already here. Communities of families have grown up to provide advice and encouragement and a happy source of friendship.</p>
		<p>But, when parents such as Ana Watson arrive with little more than a desperately sick child and a hope to make it better, they walk into uncharted territory. They become part of a medical experiment that plays out in living rooms, not doctors&rsquo; offices.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be the parent who didn&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; said Janea Cox, a mother from Georgia who brought her daughter to Colorado in March for treatment of seizures that left her unable to even breathe on her own. The move meant breaking up her family; her husband remained at home in Georgia.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Colorado represents hope at this point,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is the state of hope.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>A spectrum of illnesses afflict the children coming to Colorado for medical marijuana: cancer, autism, Crohn&rsquo;s disease. Most, though, are seeking help for incurable forms of childhood epilepsy &mdash; diseases with names taken from medical-journal bylines: <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="<em>(pronounced druh-VAY)</em> A rare form of epilepsy with onset in early childhood.

		<p>The migration began <a title="Legalization's opening of medical pot research is dream and nightmare" href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_24726291/legalizations-opening-medical-pot-research-is-dream-and">just over a year ago</a>, when CNN <a title="Dr Sanjay Gupta's CNN Special &quot;WEED&quot;" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3IMfIQ_K6U">aired a documentary</a> featuring a Colorado girl named Charlotte Figi, whose constant seizures caused her to stop speaking for months. While taking a form of the marijuana treatment, the seizures subsided, and she bloomed anew into a happy child seen laughing and playing in video clips. News <a title="Families migrating to Colorado for a medical marijuana miracle" href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/mobile3/57052556-219/piper-annie-seizures-cbd.html.csp">stories</a> <a title="Parents move to Colorado for 'miracle' pot for children" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/17/moving-medical-marijuana-epilepsy-children/5255323/">began</a> <a title="Families head west for miracle marijuana to save their children's lives" href="http://www.kshb.com/news/health/families-head-west-for-miracle-marijuana-to-save-their-childrens-lives">reporting</a> that other children were seeing similarly miraculous results. To parents of kids with severe disorders, the articles seemed almost out of a storybook. So it was fitting that the brothers who grew the marijuana for the kids named their product <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="The most famous CBD product being used in Colorado to treat seizures in kids. Charlotte&rsquo;s Web is produced by the Stanley brothers and sold to pre-approved families through the brothers&rsquo; Indispensary medical-marijuana shop in Colorado Springs. The non-profit Realm of Caring was formed to assist patients using Charlotte&rsquo;s Web. Named after Charlotte Figi, the first child to use Charlotte&rsquo;s Web to control seizures. Though Charlotte&rsquo;s Web is often referred to as a type of marijuana, the Stanleys said this fall that it is actually made from at least two different kinds of marijuana plants.">Charlotte&rsquo;s Web</span>.</p>
		<p>Smaller numbers of children in California and other states have also begun to use marijuana to treat seizures. But what makes Colorado the epicenter is the state&rsquo;s large medical marijuana system, which allows for kids to be registered patients; the growing community of families with sick children; and the feedback loop of publicity that surrounds the treatment. Every happy story about a family seeing success with <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="The scientific name for marijuana. The genus Cannabis encompasses everything from plants high in THC to industrial hemp. Cultivation of any kind of cannabis plant in the United States is illegal under federal law, with a few, limited exceptions.">cannabis</span> in Colorado pushes another family to move here.</p>
		<p>Today, there are 427 children under 18 on the state&rsquo;s <a title="Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment medical marijuana page" href="http://www.colorado.gov/cdphe/medicalmarijuana">medical marijuana registry</a>, including 13 under 2 years old. That total number is up from just 60 in August 2013, when the documentary aired. More arrive every month.</p>
		<p>This is marijuana that often comes in medicine bottles, an oil extract from cannabis plants that is frequently squirted under a patient&rsquo;s tongue. It&rsquo;s the opposite of most commercial cannabis. Rather than being high in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="The most famous cannabinoid found in marijuana. THC is psychoactive and causes marijuana&rsquo;s euphoric effects. Preliminary research suggests it may also have therapeutic value. Its precursor, THC-A, is non-psychoactive and must be heated to cause a high.">THC</span> &mdash; the plant&rsquo;s psychoactive chemical &mdash; the marijuana is low in THC and rich in CBD, a compound that does not get users stoned but has shown medicinal potential.</p>
		<p>The few, small studies of its efficacy, though, are preliminary and even disputed. Federal laws against marijuana have hampered research on <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A cannabinoid found in marijuana. Preliminary research suggests CBD may be effective at controlling seizures and that it could also have anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety and cancer-fighting properties.

As a result, states have increasingly <a title="Lawmakers in 11 states approve low-THC medical marijuana bills" href="http://www.denverpost.com/marijuana/ci_26059454/lawmakers-11-states-approve-low-thc-medical-marijuana">passed their own laws legalizing CBD</a>, based on little more than stories such as Charlotte Figi&rsquo;s and the hopes of families following in her path.</p>
		<p>An <a title="Whole Cannabis Extract of High Concentration Cannabidiol May Calm Seizures in Highly Refractory Pediatric Epilepsies" href="http://hope4childrenwithepilepsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Dr.-Gedde-Abstract.pdf">early and oft-reported survey</a> of children on Charlotte&rsquo;s Web found that 80 percent who tried it eliminated at least three of every four of their seizures. Now, even one of the specialists involved in that study questions whether it was overly optimistic. Subsequent studies <a title="Parental Reporting of Response To Oral Cannabis Extracts As Adjunctive Treatment For Medically Refractory Epilepsy" href="http://www.aesnet.org/meetings_events/annual_meeting_abstracts/view/1868031">have suggested</a> the response rate might be closer to 30 percent or, perhaps, even lower.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s not just that parents are taking a gamble by moving to Colorado. It&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t even know the odds.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When these kids come, we hear a lot about it,&rdquo; said Dr. Larry Wolk, head of the Colorado health department and a skeptic of the treatment&rsquo;s success. &ldquo;They get their CBD oil or their Charlotte&rsquo;s Web. And if they respond, we continue to hear about it. If they don&rsquo;t, they quickly disappear.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Like all of the parents coming to Colorado in search of a cure, Ana Watson hopes hers will become a success story. Staying in North Carolina offered no hope for Preston. Still, she can&rsquo;t predict what lies ahead.</p>
		<p>The journey would be harder and more complicated than she ever imagined.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Preston&rsquo;s journey</h3>

		<p class="lead">Preston&rsquo;s baby book begins with pictures from a sonogram.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy!&rdquo; the sticker on the page proclaims.</p>
		<p>Turn the page, and there&rsquo;s a picture of Preston in a white onesie. Then a picture of Preston sitting in a kid-sized Jeep.</p>
		<p>On the next page is a picture of Preston with his head swaddled in gauze, a thick bundle of electrical wires poking out of the top of the wrapping like a bizarre ponytail.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The Journey&rdquo; is the title of this new section in the book.</p>
		<p>It sounds so much better than calling it an ordeal.</p>
		<p>Ana was only 19 when she learned she was pregnant with Preston. She was a college freshman who had to take a break from school and live with her parents for a few months in rural Whitsett, N.C., while she prepared for motherhood. Her pregnancy was normal, aside from the delicate tremors she sometimes thought she felt in her womb. Her high school sweetheart, Preston&rsquo;s father, drifted out of her life. He has never seen Preston in person.</p>
		<p>After Preston&rsquo;s birth, the doctors told Ana that his strange leg twitches were common &mdash; the result of underdeveloped muscles. It was three months later that she learned the doctors were wrong.</p>
		<p>She was giving Preston a bath &mdash; not his first, not unusual. But then his eyes rolled back in his head and his face went white and his little body began to shake and Ana was certain he was dying. At the hospital, doctors quickly sent her home. Lots of kids have random seizures that never recur, they said. But Preston&rsquo;s did.</p>
		<p>Ana doesn&rsquo;t remember what Preston&rsquo;s first word was. What she does remember is that first word arrived right on time. As did his first crawls. And his first steps.</p>
		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until his second year of life that Ana began to notice the toll the seizures were taking. When other kids Preston&rsquo;s age were learning more words and stringing them into sentences, he didn&rsquo;t. When walking and grasping led to running and catching for other children, it didn&rsquo;t for Preston. It was as though his life ground to a stop, even as time ticked on.</p>
		<p>The neurologists were baffled and kept hunting for new medicines.</p>
		<p>They started with a drug called <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A brand name for a drug containing valproic acid. The drug is used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraine headaches. Side effects include tremors. It was the first drug Preston used for seizures and is one of three pharmaceuticals he still takes regularly.">Depakote</span> when Preston was 3 months old. But the seizures continued &mdash; as did the new treatments: Klonopin and Felbatol and Keppra. Zonegran and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="The brand name for the drug topiramate. Used to treat seizures and migraine headaches.

A special high-fat diet. An implanted electrical nerve stimulator. There were two other drugs not yet fully approved by the federal government that cost hundreds of dollars a month. There was another that has also been suggested for use in executions.</p>
		<p>The government <a title="FDA Drug Safety and Availability page" href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/">safety sheets</a> for each drug listed dozens of side effects. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Depakote" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM342868.pdf">Tremors</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Klonopin" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM225680.pdf">Problems with walking or coordination</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Zonegran" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM152828.pdf">A potentially fatal rash</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Topamax" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM152837.pdf">Panic attacks</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Banzel" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm088564.pdf">Thoughts of suicide</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Keppra" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM152832.pdf">Aggression</a>.</p>
		<p>To Ana, it sometimes seemed as if what epilepsy didn&rsquo;t take from her son, the drugs would. But she also knew that just one year of uncontrolled seizures meant a 1 percent chance of dying. The longer Preston&rsquo;s seizures ran riot, the likelier epilepsy would kill him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re fighting for your child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You just do whatever it takes to get what you need for your child. People slack off. You have to stay on top of them.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Being Preston&rsquo;s mother taught her not to cry because tears won&rsquo;t make her son better. For her, there is a process: Try one thing, then move on to the next. Lessons can be learned and applied.</p>
		<p>So Ana kept searching for a cure.</p>
		<p>Her bookshelf at home charted the journey and spoke to her struggle. First came &ldquo;What to Expect in the First Year.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;Keeping Faith.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;Delmar&rsquo;s Drug Reference for Health Care Professionals.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;Three Weeks to Say Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ana married, and Sydney was born. She and her husband fell into debt, in part because of medical bills before Preston qualified for Medicaid. Their marriage collapsed under the stress, and Ana moved back in with her parents. She tried working full time, then cut back to part time.</p>
		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Preston was 6 years old that doctors finally put a name to his condition: <a title="What is Dravet syndrome?" href="http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/what-is-dravet-syndrome">Dravet 
		syndrome</a>. And in some ways, that was worse than not knowing at all because it meant there was no cure to find.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;Seizures all of the time&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">At the North Carolina Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Chapel Hill in May, Dr. Robert Greenwood hustled into the meeting room wearing a tie covered with Dr. Seuss characters.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a constant struggle of trying to limit the number of seizures he has,&rdquo; Greenwood said of Preston, who at age 1 started as a patient of Greenwood&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We have tried literally everything.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>As a pediatric neurologist, Greenwood had treated hundreds of kids with epilepsy in his 37-year career. But Preston&rsquo;s case was a unique challenge.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;In his case, the biggest problem is he has seizures every day,&rdquo; Greenwood said. &ldquo;Multiple seizures. At times, he could walk down the hall and you could see 10 to 20 seizures happening, little jerks. So he was literally having seizures all of the time.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Dravet isn&rsquo;t like other epilepsies.</p>
		<p>While some can be treated by targeting the specific areas of the brain where the seizures&rsquo; electrical overloads originate, Dravet&rsquo;s seizures come from everywhere, the result of a genetic mutation that occurs in every nerve cell in the brain.</p>
		<p>Some epilepsies respond well to generalized anti-seizure drugs. But the specific genetic mutation of each Dravet patient is different, meaning what works for some won&rsquo;t work for others. Preston has at least four different kinds of seizure types, and they varied in severity and frequency as he grew older.</p>
		<p>There are the grand mals, full of violent convulsing that can last minutes, which Preston falls into about once a week. But much more common are the little eye flutters. In medical terms, they are called <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A brief seizure characterized by little muscle jerks. Preston&rsquo;s eyelid flutters are a myoclonic seizure. Ana calls them blinkies.">myoclonic seizures</span>. Ana calls them &ldquo;blinkies.&rdquo; They look as though Preston is on the verge of sneezing.</p>
		<p>He can have hundreds of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="What Ana calls Preston&rsquo;s eyelid-flutter seizures, his most frequent seizure type. Preston can have hundreds of them a day. Clinically, they are known as myoclonic seizures.">blinkies</span> a day. And, though they usually pass gently, each one is like an eraser across his brain&rsquo;s chalkboard. Over and over, new development is wiped clean by the seizures. So, over and over, he learns the same things.</p>
		<p>At 12 years old, Preston cannot spell his name. He cannot reliably count to 10. He is still learning his colors. He doesn&rsquo;t know his mom&rsquo;s name or where he lives or how to call home if he gets lost. He wobbles when he walks and falls over easily.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, Greenwood and Ana would find a medicine that worked for Preston. The seizures would lessen and Preston would start to walk more steadily. But, just as quickly, Preston&rsquo;s brain would rewire itself back to a broken state and the seizures would return. </p>
		<p>Sitting in the hospital meeting room, Greenwood said there was little more he could do for Preston with the medicines available. Without something new, Preston&rsquo;s seizures would continue into adulthood &mdash; assuming he didn&rsquo;t die before then.</p>
		<p>Asked whether Preston would ever be able to speak a complete sentence, Greenwood&rsquo;s eyes lit up with the idea, then quickly dimmed.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That would be really nice if he got that far,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s not much evidence right now he&rsquo;s moving toward that.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Keeping daydreams in check</h3>

		<p class="lead">Preston&rsquo;s eyes slowly opened somewhere under the fluff of his mother&rsquo;s comforter.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Time to get up, Boo-Boo,&rdquo; Ana said to him. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>A voice tiptoed back to her with the peanut-butter-mouth slur of a child&rsquo;s early words: &ldquo;Wuh moh minuh.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Ana said, &ldquo;One more minute.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>It was about a month before the move away from their little brick house in Greensboro, N.C., and, sometime in the night before, Preston left his own bed and sleepwalked into Ana&rsquo;s. Sydney was already there. When Ana woke before dawn, she was nestled between children.</p>
		<p>Once begun, the morning ticked along with practiced precision. Ana made the fried potatoes Preston only ever wants for breakfast. Eight-year-old Sydney quietly dressed and got ready on her own, until it was time to ask mom to fix her ponytail.</p>
		<p>Finally dragging Preston from bed, Ana sat him in his skull-and-crossbones pajamas in front of the television and turned on a video of Barney the dinosaur. Sydney walked by and scrunched up her face. She had already outgrown Barney.</p>
		<p>But Preston watched rapturously, planting his elbows onto his knees and his head into his hands. His eyes are a deep walnut color and are framed by long eyelashes. Brown hair swirls atop his head in casual rebellion. His smile is all in the top lip, pulling up past his gum line to reveal a row of glimmering teeth.</p>
		<p>Slowly working his way through the potatoes, Preston&rsquo;s hands stopped and his eyelids flickered for a few seconds before popping back open. The first seizure of the day had come and gone.</p>
		<p>Over the fireplace hung a photo of Preston in a straw cowboy hat. He&rsquo;s shirtless, leaning onto his left elbow. His mouth is closed and his eyes set in a stoic glare, and he appears startlingly mature &mdash; a boy trying to look like a man trying to look like a rock star.</p>
		<p>There are times, Ana said, when she can almost see what Preston could become if the seizures would just let him.</p>
		<p>Everyone in her family has their own vision of what Preston might be. Ana&rsquo;s mom sees Preston getting a job at a park running a lawn mower. Ana&rsquo;s dad &mdash; the man who taught Preston how to be a boy, to love mowers and tractors, and to shout, &ldquo;Crank it!&rdquo; &mdash; imagines playing catch with his grandson.</p>
		<p>Ana tries to keep her daydreams in check. What good is it to view her child as something he&rsquo;s not? But there is one thing she hears the parents of Dravet children often say, and, yes, she hesitantly admitted, she would like it, too.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The big thing that parents are always saying,&rdquo; Ana said, &ldquo;is they want their child to say, ‘I love you.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">A leap into the unknown</h3>

		<p class="lead">Ana&rsquo;s decision to move had seemed like an easy one. In late 2012, she saw on Facebook <a title="Medical marijuana helps stem 6-year-old's seizures" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/10/health/medical-marijuana-child/">a video</a> of a California man using medical marijuana to treat his son&rsquo;s seizures. &ldquo;This brought tears to my eyes!&rdquo; she wrote then.</p>
		<p>The documentary about Charlotte Figi <a title="Marijuana stops child's severe seizures" href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/health/charlotte-child-medical-marijuana/">aired 
		the next summer</a>, and by late 2013 &mdash; as Preston approached his 12th birthday stuck in the same developmental rut he had been in for his previous nine &mdash; the online whispers of a marijuana miracle in Colorado had turned into a roar. One by one, other Dravet children&rsquo;s parents &mdash; with whom Ana had become close friends online but never met in person &mdash; began arriving in Colorado, posting hopeful updates on their children&rsquo;s progress. The hope tugged at her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve pretty much tried everything else we can,&rdquo; she reasoned.</p>
		<p>And so this was the logical next step. A leap into the unknown.</p>
		<p>The closer the move came, the worse Preston seemed to get. He suffered a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A seizure characterized by violent convulsing and loss of consciousness. Also known as a tonic-clonic seizure.">grand-mal seizure</span> at the fundraiser Ana and her parents put together to raise the $15,000 needed for the move. He suffered another grand mal returning from a last-second beach getaway.</p>
		<p>He grew reluctant to eat or drink, which left him not only weak but also not getting the right dose of medicine hidden in his food. The day the movers arrived, Preston sat on the grass holding his grandmother&rsquo;s hand while the blinkies attacked.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wha doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he shouted between seizures, because he didn&rsquo;t know what it meant for the movers to be there.</p>
		<p>In advance of the move, Ana reduced the dose of one of the three main seizure medicines he takes &mdash; a drug called <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="The brand name for the drug clobazam. A type of benzodiazepine, Onfi is used to treat seizures. Side effects include sleepiness, clumsiness and slowness of thinking. Onfi is one of three pharmaceuticals that Preston regularly takes.">Onfi</span> &mdash; because she had heard from other parents that CBD amplifies it. He was now taking about a third less than what Greenwood had prescribed, although she didn&rsquo;t tell the doctor her plan.
		</p>
		<p>Greenwood had been cautiously supportive of Ana&rsquo;s move, in part because it preserved some of his input into Preston&rsquo;s care. Tell a family no when they&rsquo;re on the trail of hope, and they&rsquo;ll leave you behind. For all of the parents asking him about moving to Colorado &mdash; Ana was not the first &mdash; Greenwood had told them the same thing: There&rsquo;s no hard evidence it works, but there&rsquo;s no hard evidence it&rsquo;s causing harm, either.</p>
		<p>When he looked at the exodus of families heading to Colorado, Greenwood worried about the people who might prey on their desperation. But he also worried about the enthusiasm that might spring from their hope. He had warned Ana strongly against taking Preston off his other seizure drugs.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He is quite capable of going into a seizure that is basically all the time &mdash; all day and all night,&rdquo; Greenwood said.</p>
		<p>After the movers left, Preston&rsquo;s blinkies hit even worse. Drool dribbled off his chin and onto his T-shirt. Milly, who was watching him while Ana packed up the last things, sensed a bigger seizure building. She fanned Preston, hoping to calm the blinking.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;d get used to seeing him like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it scares me to death every time.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Hope for Preston</h3>

		<p class="lead">It took 12 days after arriving in Colorado for Ana to get the marijuana oil for Preston&rsquo;s first dose. Twelve days of waiting. Twelve days of seizing. Twelve days of wondering what would happen.</p>
		<p>She had to wait another three days after picking up the oil for a lab report to come back to confirm its potency. When the day of the first dose finally arrived, in mid-July, Ana bounded into the kitchen of her new home to pull a bottle of the oil from the fridge.</p>
		<p>She cracked it open and burst into giggles.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It smells like marijuana,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Drawing the amber-colored oil into a dropper, she scanned the report to figure out how much she should give Preston. But the report was indecipherable. The oil contained 5.65 milligrams of CBD and 0.15 milligrams of THC. How could she convert all these different numbers into the recommended dose? </p>
		<p>She checked her phone for online answers. Finally, eager to move on, she set the phone down.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure it out later.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She drew a small amount of oil into the dropper and looked over to Preston.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We have a special squirt-squirt we need to do, OK? You need to be a big boy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>Walking toward him, she had no idea of the frustration ahead, and no inkling of the discomfort she would inflict on them both in her effort to bring relief.</p>
		<p>All she knew as she looked toward her seizing son was that she held in her hands the latest, best chance to move his life forward.</p>
		<p>With the first dose given, she returned to the kitchen and shakily exhaled.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she breathed back in, &ldquo;was pain.&rdquo;</p>

<section id="part1">

<div class="row">
	<div class="large-9 large-centered medium-11 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p class="lead">Inside Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado, Ana Watson stares across the small exam room at the woman in a white lab coat quizzing her.</p>
		<p>Banzel?</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Tried it,&rdquo; Ana says.</p>
		<p>Keppra?</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Is that the one that causes the rash?&rdquo; Ana asks.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Keppra often causes behavioral issues,&rdquo; the doctor responds.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what we got with that,&rdquo; Ana says.</p>
		<p>The doctor continues down the list of anti-epilepsy medications, collecting the medical history of Ana&rsquo;s 12-year-old son, Preston, whose seizures cause such unrelenting brain damage that he functions at the level of a 2-year-old. The doctor ticks through 13 different medicines, but Preston has already tried each one, to little effect.</p>
		<p>That&rsquo;s why Ana moved her family across the country to Colorado, where Preston could try a treatment that&rsquo;s not on the doctor&rsquo;s list. Three days before the doctor&rsquo;s appointment in mid-July, Ana gave Preston his first dose of an unregulated medical marijuana extract that is high in a compound called CBD. Hundreds of families like Ana&rsquo;s have moved to Colorado for the treatment, hoping it will calm their children&rsquo;s seizures.</p>
		<p>A desperate hope and well-publicized stories about kids who have responded to the drug drive the families here, despite scant research on CBD&rsquo;s overall efficacy. Scientists know so little about the treatment that it&rsquo;s not even clear what CBD might do in the brain to impact seizures.</p>
		<p>So, the entire day after that first dose, Ana watched Preston like a poker player looking for a tell.</p>
		<p>Preston yawned. Did that mean the marijuana made him sleepy? Preston ate. Did the extract make him hungry? Preston didn&rsquo;t seem to seize as often.</p>
		<p>Was it working?</p>
		<p>Then the next day, Preston suffered a grand mal seizure that left him writhing violently. He had another one the day after that. Getting him to eat or drink had become nearly impossible, and that meant he wasn&rsquo;t getting consistent doses of either the CBD treatment or his traditional medications, both of which Ana tried to hide in Preston&rsquo;s food or sweet tea.</p>
		<p>So now Ana is sitting in the hospital whose doctors have been the most outspoken in Colorado in urging parents not to use marijuana to control seizures &mdash; it&rsquo;s too risky, they say; there are too many unknowns &mdash; and she is hoping for advice on what to do.</p>
		<p><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A special high-fat, ultra-low-carbohydrate diet used to treat epilepsy. When deprived of carbohydrates, the body turns instead to fat for energy, producing ketone bodies that can aid in controlling seizures.">Ketogenic diet</span>, the doctor asks?</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Basically, we&rsquo;ve tried it all,&rdquo; Ana says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we moved here for CBD. His doctors said we can&rsquo;t go up in his meds anymore, and we were at a stopping point.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The doctor looks at her list. She looks sympathetically at Ana.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Have you tried <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="An experimental drug in the United States that is marketed under the brand name Diacomit in Europe. Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado is one of several hospitals across the country able to prescribe Stiripentol as part of a program to provide experimental drugs to people suffering from rare diseases. Doctors at the hospital recommend patients try Stiripentol before considering CBD. Along with Onfi and Depakote, Stiripentol makes up what some patients and doctors tout as the &ldquo;Magic Three&rdquo; for treating Dravet syndrome.">Stiripentol?&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ana sighs, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve tried everything.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t make recommendations&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">The CBD rush to Colorado is a movement that divides patients from doctors.</p>
		<p>Even as families flock to the state, few doctors here condone the use of marijuana to treat seizures. And that means the very people on whom families depend for medical advice are often silent when it comes to critical questions about the new treatment.</p>
		<p>The state health department, which manages the patient registry that all children using medical marijuana must join, offers almost no guidance.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What I always tell people is you have to be really careful,&rdquo; said Dr. Larry Wolk, the executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. &ldquo;They have to know that it&rsquo;s outside of the regulatory process, outside of the (Food and Drug Administration), and it&rsquo;s very much &lsquo;Buyer beware.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
		<p>Many of the families arriving in the state for medical marijuana &mdash; as well as those already living here &mdash; seek out the care of specialists at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado. About 100 kids who see doctors at the hospital have tried a CBD treatment.</p>
		<p>But no doctor at Children&rsquo;s recommends using cannabis or gives more than cautious advice about it.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t make recommendations about the marijuana therapy because we don&rsquo;t have the information to do that,&rdquo; said Dr. Amy Brooks-Kayal, the head of pediatric neurology at Children&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We feel very strongly that we need to act on good medical and scientific evidence, and that doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</p>
		<p><a title="CBD and marijuana: Q-PULSE Survey" href="http://www.aesnet.org/sites/default/files/file_attach/ProfessionalEducation/Currents/2014/epcu-14-5-291%20Its%20Current%20Carlson.pdf">A national survey</a> of doctors by the American Epilepsy Society found that while 94 percent said they have been asked by a patient about using cannabis to control seizures, fewer than a third would actually recommend that patients try it. Another 13 percent said they would support its use but would rather have another doctor provide the recommendation needed to obtain it.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;For the doctor to know what they need to know about an illegal drug is a very high expectation,&rdquo; said Dr. Jacqueline French, an epilepsy specialist at New York University&rsquo;s Langone Medical Center. She said CBD is &ldquo;driving the conversation&rdquo; many doctors now have with their patients.</p>
		<p>The result of that one-sided conversation, though, is that parents who give CBD to their children must turn to one another and their medical marijuana providers for help. Facebook has become a crowd-sourced doctor&rsquo;s office. Colorado&rsquo;s sometimes ragtag community of medical marijuana growers acts as a de facto human services agency.</p>
		<p>By not engaging more with providers, doctors often lack an understanding of the types of marijuana products their patients are using and are unaware of the sometimes contradictory advice their patients receive.</p>
		<p>For instance, CBD providers commonly tell newly arrived parents that they should reduce the level of an anti-seizure drug called Onfi before starting CBD because the two could have a dangerous interaction. Parents often reduce the medicine without consulting with their doctors. Doctors at Children&rsquo;s, though, say they haven&rsquo;t seen conclusive evidence that CBD has an impact on Onfi levels. Meager research makes it impossible to know who is right.</p>
		<p>Some physicians are now stepping forward to work with providers on <a title="Finally, Some Hard Science on Medical Marijuana for Epilepsy Patients" href="http://time.com/3264691/medical-marijauna-epilepsy-research-charlottes-web-study/">on clinical trials for CBD</a>, and doctors at Children&rsquo;s have begun recording more specific details of the CBD products their patients are using &mdash; who is providing the medical marijuana and how much the child is taking, for instance. But the broader dynamic still hinders the study of CBD&rsquo;s effectiveness. And that only increases the uncertainty that hangs over families such as Ana&rsquo;s in their Colorado exile.</p>
		<p>Leaving Children&rsquo;s after the first visit, Ana still has questions about CBD. But doctors there have set up several new appointments to address other aspects of Preston&rsquo;s care. He will soon have a feeding tube inserted into his stomach, allowing Ana to give him food and medicine consistently. She&rsquo;ll take him to get fitted for a new helmet to protect him in falls.</p>
		<p>A plan is taking shape.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I thought it went really well,&rdquo; she says.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Parents hope to see progress</h3>

		<p class="lead">Two days later, they&rsquo;re back again. A blue line squiggles furiously up and down on a computer screen.</p>
		<p>Preston is talking.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Silly mommy,&rdquo; he says to Ana, as she snuggles into a single hospital bed with him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Silly Preston,&rdquo; she says back.</p>
		<p>He leans in to give her a kiss on the cheek. A maroon line on the computer screen jumps to life.</p>
		<p>A bundle of 21 multicolored electrical wires poke from the top of a wrapping on Preston&rsquo;s head, running off the bed and to the computer. Every gesture, every word, every eye blink shows up as activity on the screen, where blue, brown and green lines measure Preston&rsquo;s brain activity. It is one answer to the question that has vexed Ana for the past 12 years: What is happening inside her son&rsquo;s head?</p>
		<p>But, even now, the seizures remain a mystery. Some little eye-flutter seizures cause leaping spikes on the screen. Some seem to skip by without a change in the pattern. So chaotic is Preston&rsquo;s brain that, looking later at the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="<em>(EEG)</em> A reading of the brain&rsquo;s electrical activity. EEGs are taken by affixing 21 electrical wires &mdash; or leads &mdash; to standardized positions on the scalp. The wires&rsquo; readings are displayed on a monitor, which shows fluctuations in activity in different areas of the brain.">electroencephalogram</span>, or EEG, doctors will have a hard time telling from the readings when he was awake and when he was asleep, when he was seizing and when he was still.</p>
		<p>At the end of their first visit, Dr. Kelly Knupp, Preston&rsquo;s new neurologist at Children&rsquo;s, suggested the EEG so that the hospital could have some starting record of Preston&rsquo;s brain activity. The timing worked; Preston was already in the hospital, after the feeding tube surgery the day before.</p>
		<p>But, to get a true starting level, the EEG meant Ana would need to take Preston off CBD temporarily. She had spent seven months planning how to get to Colorado for the treatment. She was pausing it after five days.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The point of this is to get a baseline,&rdquo; Knupp had told Ana, &ldquo;so that after you&rsquo;re on CBD, you can have a baseline to look at.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>While doctors at Children&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t exactly want their patients on CBD, they are eager to find out what it&rsquo;s doing. Knupp told Ana that doctors at the hospital now recommend all patients have both an EEG and a bloodwork exam prior to starting CBD. They would like to run follow-up tests every three or four months.</p>
		<p>The results from the first batch of CBD kids tested made their way <a title="Parental Reporting of Response To Oral Cannabis Extracts As Adjunctive Treatment For Medically Refractory Epilepsy" href="http://www.aesnet.org/meetings_events/annual_meeting_abstracts/view/1868031">into a study</a> that Knupp and two other doctors will present this week at the <a title="American Epilepsy Society annual meeting abstract search" href="http://www.aesnet.org/meetings_events/annual_meeting_abstracts">American Epilepsy Society conference</a> in Seattle. Of the 58 children tested, 31 percent saw their seizures reduce by half, the study found. About 50 percent of the patients saw at least some seizure reduction.</p>
		<p>But the results were ultimately even less conclusive.</p>
		<p>The doctors relied on parents to report how much CBD reduced seizures. And that opened the door for the study&rsquo;s two most intriguing findings.</p>
		<p>The hospital didn&rsquo;t see any improvement in the before-and-after EEGs of four kids whose seizures appeared to lessen significantly. That may have been due to something called &ldquo;electroclinical dissociation,&rdquo; where the seizure still occurs but its outward indicators disappear. It also might be that parents can pick up on smaller improvements than an EEG can, said Dr. Kevin Chapman, a pediatric neurologist at Children&rsquo;s who was a co-author on the study.</p>
		<p>But the study also calls into question parents&rsquo; ability to be objective. The doctors found that parents who had moved to Colorado for medical marijuana were much more likely to report that it had helped their children significantly than those who were already living in Colorado &mdash; 52 percent compared with 17 percent. In other words, the greater the leap of hope it took to try CBD, the more likely a parent was to see progress.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We worry about all the stresses that families had to go through to start the treatment,&rdquo; Chapman said. &ldquo;That desire for it to be effective may cloud their recognition of seizures.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Supporters of the CBD treatment say Children&rsquo;s sample was skewed because the hospital might not be seeing the kids doing best on medical marijuana. State health officials <a title="Colorado health officials recommend grants to 8 marijuana studies" href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27005133/colorado-health-officials-recommend-grants-8-marijuana-studies">have recommended</a> that Children&rsquo;s receive <a title="Medical marijuana research grant recommendations" href="http://www.colorado.gov/cdphe/MMR-research-grant-recommendations">nearly $1 million in grants</a> in grants for further research.</p>
		<p>Even if the treatment is successful, though, no one knows what will happen if kids who have seized their whole lives suddenly stop. Do they develop normally? Or does their underlying condition continue to inhibit their growth?</p>
		<p>Including the new Children&rsquo;s study, the nine studies or surveys looking at whether CBD controls seizures in humans form a scientific crazy quilt.</p>
		<p>They look at different forms of epilepsy, different kinds of seizures and different measurements of success. At least five different types of CBD-rich marijuana therapies are represented in the studies.</p>
		<p>The results swing wildly. The studies show anywhere from 30 to 80 percent of children seeing a significant seizure reduction while on CBD. And now even some doctors involved in the research question the findings.</p>
		<p>Dr. Edward Maa, an epilepsy specialist at Denver Health Medical Center, worked with the most famous CBD provider in Colorado, the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A non-profit organization that provides assistance to families using the Charlotte&rsquo;s Web CBD product. Founded by Paige Figi and Heather Jackson, the parents of the first and third child, respectively, to try Charlotte&rsquo;s Web.  Affiliated with the Stanley brothers, who produce Charlotte&rsquo;s Web.">Realm of Caring</span>, and a Colorado Springs medical marijuana doctor on <a title="Whole Cannabis Extract of High Concentration Cannabidiol May Calm Seizures in Highly Refractory Pediatric Epilepsies" href="http://hope4childrenwithepilepsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Dr.-Gedde-Abstract.pdf">a patient survey</a> &mdash; one of the earliest studies on the efficacy of CBD in the state. The study found that nine out of the 11 families surveyed saw at least a 75 percent reduction in seizures. It was an overwhelming success rate.</p>
		<p>But now Maa wonders whether families who tried CBD with little success quit using the treatment before they could be included in the study. The Realm of Caring says only one patient had stopped using CBD at the time the survey was conducted. Maa is working on <a title="Genetic Analysis Between Charlotte's Web Responders Versus Non- Responders in a Dravet Population" href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02229032">a genetic study</a> trying to determine why some kids respond to CBD and some don&rsquo;t.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of people, if they were going to respond, had a dramatic reduction of seizures,&rdquo; Maa said. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t represent the larger, global number of people who had exposure to it. We don&rsquo;t know those true numbers yet.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;An uncontrolled experiment&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">A faint smell of cow manure wafts in the breeze as Ana pulls her minivan up to a house in eastern Boulder County.</p>
		<p>In the five weeks since Preston left the hospital, Ana has restarted him on CBD &mdash; now shooting it efficiently into his feeding tube. Preston went the first two weeks without suffering a grand mal, but his blinky seizures remained.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t seem to me to be as long,&rdquo; Ana said.</p>
		<p>The CBD oil she was using then was a roughly 35:1 mixture of CBD to THC. But Ana, concerned that she wasn&rsquo;t using the best formulation, sought out the opinion of a Denver doctor who specializes in making medical marijuana recommendations. The doctor, Alan Shackelford, suggested Ana try a mix with more THC.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;In a way,&rdquo; he told Ana, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an uncontrolled experiment. Which I don&rsquo;t necessarily like. But we are pressed into this circumstance.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>So Ana visited her CBD provider, who gave her oil at a 10:1 ratio of CBD to THC, and the next day she watched as her son ate better than he had in months: a plate of fried okra, a plate of potato chips smothered in barbecue sauce, a stick of string cheese, a Frosty and, most surprising of all, tuna salad with crackers.</p>
		<p>Preston&rsquo;s grandmother, Milly, thought he had the munchies.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But you have to be careful that you&rsquo;re not making things in your brain,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all watching him and his behavior.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>While Preston played later in the backyard August sunshine, his eyes seemed to roar.</p>
		<p>The toy was a Slip &lsquo;N Slide, on which he and his sister, Sydney, were supposed to be shooting across the tarp and under an inflatable shark&rsquo;s mouth that held a spraying hose. Instead, Preston grabbed the hose and became the shark.</p>
		<p>His hunting spared no one. He drenched Milly. Sydney escaped back inside, water dripping down her hair. And Preston laughed with such big gulps of air that it sounded as if his own joy might strangle him. Until, suddenly, his laughter stopped.</p>
		<p>Preston&rsquo;s legs folded under him, and he crashed hard to the ground. Milly burst from her chair and ran over to him, reaching him in time to see his eyes roll toward his brows. And then, lying there in the grass he had soaked, Preston began to shake violently.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; Milly whispered into his ear, trying to talk him out of the seizure. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Milly gathered Preston up and sat him on her lap in a chair. He breathed heavily, wheezing in and huffing out. His eyes were shut.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; Milly whispered again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The shaking calmed.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We pushed that too far, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Preston&rsquo;s breaths grew quieter.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You were being a big, mean shark. It&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>His muscles relaxed.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It was fun, though, wasn&rsquo;t it, Preston?&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">A roller coaster</h3>

		<p class="lead">The seizure &mdash; the second grand mal in a week &mdash; flustered Ana. And that&rsquo;s why she finds herself back at the house in eastern Boulder County. Jason Cranford meets her on the porch.</p>
		<p>Although he owns a medical marijuana store and several licensed cultivation warehouses, Cranford provides CBD to young patients out of his home under the state&rsquo;s <a title="Medical marijuana caregiver rules and regulations" href="http://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/medical-marijuana-caregiver-rules-and-regulations">less-stringent regulations</a> for medical marijuana <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="Small-scale medical marijuana providers. Caregivers grow marijuana for medical-marijuana patients who can&rsquo;t grow for themselves. In Colorado, caregivers are supposed to provide individualized attention and are limited to serving five patients, unless they obtain a waiver from the state health department. A recent health department proposal to put a hard cap on the number of patients caregivers can serve was rejected by the Board of Health.">caregivers</span>. He says it keeps the cost down for patients and also creates a more personal atmosphere.</p>
		<p>After he harvests his marijuana plants, he hangs them over the arms of a weight bench in his front room, ready to be trimmed. He extracts the oil in a lab he assembled in his garage. When families arrive, his German shepherd is there to greet them.</p>
		<p>Soon, Jason hands Ana new bottles of cannabis oil. This time, he&rsquo;s giving her one bottle of high-CBD oil and another bottle containing high-THC.</p>
		<p>Now she can make any ratio she wants, Jason says. It&rsquo;s the third formulation change since Preston started the oil six weeks ago.</p>
		<p>She asks about the amount she&rsquo;s giving. &ldquo;Should I up it?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you seeing any results?&rdquo; Jason asks.</p>
		<p>Ana&rsquo;s reply is quiet.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No. Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Then you need to up it,&rdquo; Jason says.</p>
		<p>In the next week, blinky seizures will overwhelm Preston each afternoon. A week after that, Ana will write on Facebook, &ldquo;Preston started a new ratio oil yesterday higher THC, today only being on it for the second day we saw 70-80 percent seizure reduction!!! BAM!!!! Bite that seizures!!!!&rdquo; And then a week after that, Preston will have three grand mals in a day. A roller coaster, Ana will call it.</p>
		<p>But for now, she walks back to her minivan and returns home to try again.</p>
		<p>She&rsquo;s learning that when it comes to Preston&rsquo;s treatment, traditional medicine and marijuana have at least this much in common: There are still far more questions than answers.</p>

		<p class="lead">The federal Affordable Care Act created &ldquo;parity&rdquo; for mental health care, requiring insurance companies to provide their customers the same coverage for mental health treatment as they do for other care. But the law does not affect negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies, said Ben Price, executive director of the Colorado Association of Health Plans.</p>
		<p>Hospital officials say that despite the law, they recoup less from private insurance companies for mental care than physical care. Denver Health, for example, is reimbursed for 32 percent of mental health billing compared with 41 percent for other medical care, according to the hospital&rsquo;s financial office. Other hospitals refused to disclose that data. Experts say it&rsquo;s too early to measure how the new health care law is increasing treatment for mental health patients. Community mental health clinics, however, are seeing an influx of new Medicaid patients.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty remarkable that insurance companies treat psychiatric care different than they treat all other care,&rdquo; Zane said. &ldquo;For some reason, brain failure is different than heart failure. That is one of the intrinsic prejudices against psychiatric insurance, and it&rsquo;s pervasive.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Insurance company executives said while it&rsquo;s true that psychiatric care generally is reimbursed at a lower rate than surgical care, rates negotiated between hospitals and insurance companies vary widely across medical specialities.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I do understand that we do have a psychiatric problem in this state,&rdquo; said Neil Waldron, chief marketing officer for Rocky Mountain Health Plans. &ldquo;But how we negotiate with the hospitals is a mutually agreed upon thing.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Denver Health Medical Center is one of the few hospitals that has psychiatric emergency services, a secure, nine-bed section separate from the main emergency department. The unit sees 3,800 patients each year, of which about 900 are admitted. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="startVideo" id="hilite1" onclick="playerScroller('video3', 'Q5b3JkcTpaLJDDENZwHn_zMBA1nyDsma', this);">Most come for evaluation</a> after police or ER doctors have placed them on mental health holds.</p>

		<p>Some patients are able to leave within hours, after family meetings and help dealing with their immediate stress. Others are sent to the 36-bed, long-term psychiatric unit, where the average stay is about seven days.</p>
		<p>Kim Nordstrom, the medical director of psychiatric emergency services, also has a law degree. Her professional degrees are at odds when she encounters a homeless person with mental illness who chooses to eat from the trash and sleep in the cold, yet has no signs of dehydration or malnutrition.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I would not want to live that way and we don&rsquo;t like to see other people live that way, but they have a right to,&rdquo; Nordstrom said. She can, however, hold a patient if the person&rsquo;s psychosis is interfering with the ability to make a plan to find food and shelter.</p>
		<p>The Medical Center of Aurora&mdash;which opened a 40-bed psychiatric unit in 2012, the first one to open in the metro area in 10 years&mdash;gets patients from as far as Pueblo and Wyoming. The unit is almost always filled to capacity, which it caps at 32 because there are not enough psychiatrists to staff a unit of 40 people.</p>
		<p>Nationally, psychiatrists are scarce, their numbers dwindling further as the profession becomes less lucrative than other specialities. In some rural parts of Colorado, there are none.</p>
		<p>For the past 10 years, Denver psychiatrist Randy Buzan&rsquo;s voice mail has said he is not accepting new patients. He already has 400. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m buried. I just don&rsquo;t have time for all these people,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Like many psychiatrists, Buzan does not take insurance and instead charges patients on a sliding scale because that&rsquo;s easier and more profitable than dealing with insurance companies. Buzan said he and some other psychiatrists avoid taking suicidal or homicidal patients because of the risks of a lawsuit if patients end up committing murder or killing themselves.</p>
		<p>The Medical Center of Aurora built its psychiatric unit as a &ldquo;community service&rdquo; because emergency rooms at all HealthONE hospitals in Colorado were warehousing patients in mental health crisis. Patients are not getting treatment before they reach crisis, and often not after leaving hospitals either, said Teresa Mayer, medical director of the psychiatric unit.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anywhere to send them. Imagine if you had appendicitis and there was nowhere to go for follow-up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible. What could have been prevented is not preventable when there is no one to care for them.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">George Brady has a thing for weed.</p>
		<p>It relaxes his mind, he says, so he smokes it even though the judge, his caseworker and his therapist keep telling him it&rsquo;s messing with his medication for schizoaffective disorder. He thinks it gives him clarity, but to everyone else, George seems more confused and forgetful when he is high.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Stay away from the marijuana,&rdquo; Judge Barajas is telling him for the 20th time at least. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a struggle for you, and especially the spice. Are we on the same page?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George, 28, sees the world through an altered reality, a haze so thick it is improved but not lifted by his monthly medication shot. He hasn&rsquo;t hurt anyone but has been to jail 36 times, usually for what he terms misunderstandings. His most recent arrest was for loitering too long at a truckstop Wendy&rsquo;s. Then he was stripped of his bus pass last summer because an agent caught him trying to sell &mdash; George says give &mdash; a bus voucher to another rider.</p>
		<p>He continued to ride anyway, because how else would he get from the motel in the shadow of Interstate 70 east of Denver to his court-ordered therapy appointments downtown?</p>

		<p>It happens all the time, this total disconnect between two systems. The courts are paying for George to get therapy and stay out of jail, while the city transportation system is taking away the bus pass he uses to get to therapy.</p>
		<p>George did not realize as it was happening that he was losing his bus pass; he figures it out in court several days later. He is wide-eyed, eyebrows raised, head cocked, giving the judge one of his signature dumbfounded looks. &ldquo;RTD is everywhere! That means I can&rsquo;t be nowhere!&rdquo; he says.</p>

		<p>George is tall and softspoken. He wears his pants baggy, still with the store tags, and lets his hair grow until it is sticking up. He says he doesn&rsquo;t know what schizoaffective disorder &mdash; a combination of schizophrenia and mood disorder that alters his perception of reality &mdash; is, really. What he has, he says, is &ldquo;hard times.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I hear imaginary voices or see imaginary people,&rdquo; he says, sitting on his motel room bed, snacking on sunflower seeds and chuckling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been feeling a lot better. I&rsquo;ve been getting rest. I&rsquo;ve been eating. I&rsquo;ve been exercising, playing basketball. I feel a lot better.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He&rsquo;s taking Trazadone to help him sleep and a monthly shot of Invega &ldquo;to be clearing my thoughts,&rdquo; George said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George, like the others, came to Court to Community because the jail nurse and other staff noticed his frequent trips to jail were connected to the state of his mental health. The majority of those in the program are charged with shoplifting, trespassing, prostitution and disturbing the peace.</p>
		<p>Defendants sent to Court to Community spend 49 percent fewer days in jail after entering the program, yet 205 percent more days in the hospital for psychiatric care. Annual cost savings come out to $1,342 per person, according to the program&rsquo;s analysis.</p>

		<p>The good news though, says program director Eric Smith at the Mental Health Center of Denver, is that more hospital time typically means defendants are improving their mental health. And <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="startVideo" id="hilite2" onclick="playerScroller('video9', 'cyc3NkcTp-FYZXrWwYYYVXT4npIbmNrZ', this);">hospitalization costs level out</a> after the initial spike caused by participation in Court to Community, according to the mental health center&rsquo;s research.</p>
		<p>George&rsquo;s life was cruising along until a year into college in New Mexico, where he was studying pharmacy. His mental health deteriorated to the point he couldn&rsquo;t focus in class and dropped out, returning to Colorado. In the last six years, he has had numerous jobs, none for long. He has been homeless several times. But George is laid-back and sunny, sticking to his daily routine of checking in with his court-assigned caseworker, who manages his federal disability check.</p>
		<p>In court, George picks fruit snacks and a candy bar from the treat basket and sits down to wait for his friend Marcus; they knew each other at East High School and reconnected in Court to Community. Marcus has to produce an essay on the dangers of PCP for the judge.</p>
		<p>If George can stay out of trouble, he will graduate from the program and get off probation this month.</p>

		<p>She never wants to return to jail. She says she is done with booze. She says she is done with her ex, also an alcoholic. Until the day she runs into him as he is being released from jail and she is heading into Thursday court.</p>
		<p>She dashes into a bathroom to comb her hair.</p>

		<p class="insetquote">&ldquo;Hello? Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home?&rdquo; <span>&mdash; Pink Floyd, Courtroom 3H</span></p>

		<p class="lead">No one is cured of mental illness, or the closely connected substance abuse, at Court to Community.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They are not curable diseases, but we are putting them in remission,&rdquo; said Shari Lewinski, program administrator for Denver&rsquo;s behavioral health courts. &ldquo;When we first meet them, they are lost, they are confused, unkempt, angry, bitter.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That is the most horrendous, cruelest aspect of mental illness &mdash; that it is a brain disease. Any other illness, you wouldn&rsquo;t argue with the doctor about what the treatment is. Your behavior is what is impacted by mental health, and people pass judgment on that.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Lewinski is notified when the jail or a judge finds someone they suspect is a good fit for Court to Community, which began eight years ago and was modeled after drug court programs that treat the root cause of drug-related crimes &mdash; addiction. The program was started by a former judge alarmed by seeing so many repeat defendants with mental illness in his courtroom.</p>
		<p>Inmates in the program are pushed to the front of the line for psychiatric services at the Mental Health Center of Denver or the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, but the wait to see a psychiatrist can still take months.</p>
		<p>Judge Barajas&rsquo; compassion for the mentally ill stems in part from his uncle, who was hit in the skull with a can opener when he was a boy. He was left with permanent brain damage that kept him in and out of the New Mexico state mental hospital much of his life.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Instead of the state hospitals, we have the county jail,&rdquo; Barajas said.</p>
		<p>His biggest challenge is convincing defendants to take their medication. The music, snacks, chit-chat and honor roll are meant to make his courtroom feel relaxed and tolerant. Court staff and defendants sing happy birthday to each other, applaud for a week of fulfilled commitments. Defendants beam when the judge ups their grades or puts them on the honor roll, which means they are called to the podium first and get to leave court sooner.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I doubt any of these folks got those grades in school,&rdquo; Barajas said.</p>
		<p>Darcy McCarthy&rsquo;s grade is raised nearly every week. The judge is in awe of her progress.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;She was disheveled. She talked a mile a minute. She didn&rsquo;t have any organized thought process,&rdquo; he says of the Darcy who walked into court last spring. &ldquo;Look at her now. It&rsquo;s night and day. It&rsquo;s just a completely different human being.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">George wants to know if he has enough money left to buy a glittering faux-diamond necklace with &ldquo;Dope&rdquo; spelled in rhinestones.</p>
		<p>He already picked out a $36 pair of hiking boots, an orange-and-black sweatshirt and a &ldquo;ragtop&rdquo; shirt with a cheetah.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If you dress nice, you feel nice, so I can&rsquo;t wait to get dressed,&rdquo; he says, ducking into a dressing room at the Gen-X store on Colfax. His mental health case manager is helping him spend his disability money, making sure he has enough left for food and rent. He buys the necklace but does not wear it to court.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You are a smart guy,&rdquo; Lewinski tells him in court. &ldquo;I like the George who stays out of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George has moved into an apartment and wants to start nursing classes at Emily Griffith Opportunity School. He spent a court-ordered night in jail because he can&rsquo;t stay away from marijuana. &ldquo;I got to try harder. Buckle down. Watch my surroundings,&rdquo; he says.</p>
		<p>He wasn&rsquo;t allowed to graduate on time, held back because his drug tests keep coming up positive for weed.</p>
		<p>Darcy McCarthy&rsquo;s attempts to stay sober and make it to her psychiatric appointments fell apart soon after her ex walked back into her life. After seven months without trouble, she was arrested in October after drinking and fighting with a stranger on a bus.</p>
		<p>Christopher White, who grew up in Hotchkiss and flunked out of school in fifth grade, was arrested soon after he was dismissed from the program. He spent three months in jail, in a solitary cell in the mental health unit, for trespassing again near the 16th Street Mall.</p>
		<p>During a jailhouse interview halfway through that sentence, and after about a month back on medication, Christopher talked of cracking codes of the &ldquo;purple people&rdquo; and the importance of reporting the codes to the anti-Christ who lives in an alley off Pennsylvania Street east of downtown. &ldquo;The purple people, they don&rsquo;t believe in Christ Jesus the King,&rdquo; he said, explaining that when he writes the codes, Jesus takes over his pen.</p>
		<p>He was upset his release date was Oct. 31.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared because it&rsquo;s the day of the dead,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Judge Barajas&rsquo; rotation as the head of Court to Community ended this fall, but he has kept in touch with several of his offenders, often through jail visits.</p>

			<p class="lead">At dawn, the shelters send them back to the streets. Or they wake up beside the river, another day to wander downtown among the workers and tourists.</p>
			<p>Two-thirds of them, the chronically homeless of Denver, have this in common: mental illness.</p>
			<p>Just one-third of those with mental illnesses are receiving treatment, based on national estimates.</p>
			<p>The causes of homelessness &mdash; job loss, family breakups, alcohol and drug abuse &mdash; often are rooted in mental illness, and treatment of mental health problems becomes even more difficult without a stable home.</p>
			<p>Housing is health care, the best form of treatment for those with mental illness living on the streets. Yet Denver has a shortage of affordable housing, leaving nonprofits and government agencies to offer a patchwork of psychiatric services to the homeless that barely reaches beyond the most severe cases.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;All of these things work together to create a feeder system into homelessness,&rdquo; said John Parvensky, president of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. &ldquo;Once people are on the streets, their mental health issues intensify. What might be mild anxiety becomes more significant anxiety. Depression certainly intensifies as well.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The need is far greater than nonprofits and government clinics can handle.</p>
			<p>The coalition&rsquo;s mental health clinic kept a waiting list for new patients until a few years ago. The staff threw it out when it reached 2,000 names.</p>
			<p>It was not &ldquo;kind, useful or ethical&rdquo; to tell people what number they were, and by the time someone on the wait list was up for an appointment, it usually was impossible to find them again, said psychiatric director Dr. Elizabeth Cookson. Now the psychiatric team accepts patients mostly through referrals from the coalition&rsquo;s primary-care staff. An unknown number are turned away when the clinic is full.</p>
			<p>The coalition has capped its waiting list for housing at 100 names, a dent in the thousands of homeless in the Denver metro area. There are now hundreds of people waiting, for months or years.</p>

		<p class="lead">This is how Chazz Worrell, 10, explains his depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and intermittent explosive disorder:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When people be mean to me, it makes me get really angry, so I have to let it all out somewhere,&rdquo; he said. He feels like he wants to hit somebody. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t do that. What I do is hit wood. It helps keep the pressure on the inside instead of letting it all out on other people.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He chops wood, builds fences, moves horses and bottle-feeds the calves at his older brother&rsquo;s small ranch in Fort Collins.</p>

		<p>The fourth-grader spends time at the ranch almost daily, and his mother says it helps him more than any other therapy. Without some release, his emotional outbursts are volatile.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He can hit things, throw things, try to break things or even hit himself,&rdquo; Liz Worrell said. The anger gives way to sadness, especially if he hurt someone or broke something. He begins to yell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stupid! I shouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Chazz&rsquo;s anxiety has him constantly worried in public that he will get lost and never see his parents again. They are buying walkie-talkies. His post-traumatic stress developed after his grandmother passed away in front of him.</p>

			<p class="caption">Chazz Worrell, 10, helps his brother, Cody Woodall, build a fence on Cody&rsquo;s ranch in Fort Collins. Chazz was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He also has anxiety and anger issues. Their mother, Liz Worrell, says that Cody understands his younger brother. &ldquo;Cody has had a rough road and been down some of the same paths.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<p>Liz has been through this before, with her now-23-year-old son, and this time, she is much more equipped to handle the school meetings that felt, the first time around, like board rooms where she was on trial for her parenting skills. Now, she brings Chazz&rsquo;s advocate from a community mental health clinic.</p>
		<p>By now, she also has shunned medication, tired of seeing her older son playing the &ldquo;guinea pig&rdquo; as doctors adjusted medications that made him sit around all day like a zombie. Instead, she gives Chazz a quiet room, with his dog, to calm down. Afterward, they talk about how he could have handled his outburst another way.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;By the time they are done here, they are worn out. The best therapy I can give them is this,&rdquo; said Liz, surrounded by calves, alpacas and horses.</p>
