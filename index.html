But what made 2014 a fascinating year in sports was the fact that very little happened as we thought it would. And that’s what makes us fanatical about sports.</p>

		<p>We thought, for instance, the Broncos would steamroll through the playoffs, but it was the Broncos who were embarrassed in the Super Bowl.</p>
		<p>We thought the Avalanche would be an adorable story of budding stars cracking the postseason, but suddenly, it won the division and was talking title &#8230; only to get ousted in the first round.</p>
		<p>We thought Rockies owner Dick Monfort would keep Dan O’Dowd in charge until 3014, but Dan finally resigned and Monfort promoted Jeff Bridich to general manager.</p>
		<p>And we thought the Colorado State Rams would maybe win seven football games, but they won 10 in the regular season &#8212; and little CSU made national news when Florida swiped its coach.</p>

		<p>Unlike baseball, football’s season isn’t neatly placed into the baking pan that is a calendar year. As such, the last NFL season spilled into 2014. In the playoffs, the Broncos and Peyton Manning sent Philip Rivers back to San Diego with his silly tie, and Denver later sent Tom Brady back to Boston with his silly boots.</p>

		<p>But from the moment Manny Ramirez sent the opening snap to Hackensack, the Super Bowl seemed doomed. Forty three. Eight.</p>
		<p>Still stings, doesn’t it?</p>
		<p>But John Elway approached free agency with the urgency of <a href="http://youtu.be/q36SIc5h6AM">The Drive</a>, yes sir. You know the story: DeMarcus Ware, T.J. Ward, Aqib Talib, an investment in nasty. And by December, Denver had one of the NFL’s formidable defenses. Oh, and after the offensive line faced <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/lunchspecial/ci_26969113/stink-knows-mark-schlereth-says-broncos-o-line">the wrath of Mark Schlereth</a>, the Broncos’ offense looked 1998-y, with <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_27064040/peyton-manning-takes-back-seat-c-j-anderson-shines-broncos">a run game</a> complementing a legendary gunslinger.</p>
		<p>The Avalanche still doesn’t get enough credit for a mesmerizing turnaround. Worst in the Western Conference in 2012-13, the Avs finished second in the conference in 2013-14. Saved by Roy, as they say. Saint Patrick became Coach Patrick, and he made believers out of these kids. Nathan MacKinnon even got Wayne Gretzky’s approval.</p>
		<p>But reality soon sunk in. The Avs were winning despite a disproportionate number of shots by other teams. In other words, Semyon Varlamov was keeping them in games by playing like his coach. And by this fall, the Avs were back to being average.</p>
		<p>The Rockies stunk, again. Troy Tulowitzki got hurt, again. Carlos Gonzalez got hurt, again. The bullpen blew saves, again. Dinger annoyed everyone, again. And even though some aging vet (Justin Morneau) won the Rockies a batting title, again, the team was basically baseball’s version of the Columbus Blue Jackets (again).</p>
		<p>The Nugs? Ugh. The Denver Nuggets stunk all of 2014. The team had numerous nice complementary pieces but hardly a nucleus to win in the playoffs &#8212; or even <i>make</i> the playoffs. As 2014 ends, one wonders who will still be with the Nuggets at this time next year.</p>
		<p>In Boulder, Colorado hoops showed promise. Colorado football, meanwhile, barely showed up, going winless in the Pac-12 conference. And there’s much excitement in Fort Collins with both sports, but questions about the football team sustaining success &#8212; in 2015 but also 2017, when the Rams’ new stadium is slated to open. And Air Force just kept winning, actually defeating CSU’s football team in <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/colleges/ci_27030740/air-force-beats-csu-last-second-fg-end">a marquee matchup</a>.</p>
		<p>In 2014, we said hello to Emmanuel Sanders and Bradley Roby, Jarome Iginla and Eddie Butler, Dee Hart and Arron Afflalo, again.</p>
		<p>And in 2014, we said goodbye to Eric Decker and Knowshon Moreno, Paul Stastny and Spencer Dinwiddie, Evan “More Champagne Mister” Fournier and the great Roland Bailey.</p>
		<p>He didn’t end his career as one, but he’ll always be Champ.</p>

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Joe Ellis</font></strong>. When Pat Bowlen <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_26199148/pat-bowlen-resigns-control-denver-broncos-acknowledges-dealing-alzheimers-disease">announced through the Denver Post</a> in July that he would step down as Broncos owner after 30 seasons because of Alzheimer’s disease, it was Ellis who was put in charge. Ellis is now the Broncos’ chief executive officer as well as president, which means he has final-say authority on all team matters. Ellis is also in charge of the Pat Bowlen Trust, which states one of Bowlen’s seven children will eventually run the team.
             <br /><span class="vote"><a href="#" class="pick" id="1" onClick="update_form('section_1', this); return false;">I pick Joe Ellis</a></span>
        </p>
		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Peyton Manning</font></strong>. More than the mayor, more than the governor, the local team’s quarterback is the face of the city. Jay Cutler never did get it. Manning has always understood his responsibility beyond the field. He represents Denver well. More importantly, he lends civic pride and hope that the Broncos will win it all.
             <br /><span class="vote"><a href="#" class="pick" id="2" onClick="update_form('section_1', this); return false;">I pick Peyton Manning</a></span>
        </p>
        <p><strong><font size="5.7em">Terrance Knighton</font></strong>. Think back to September, when the second video of Ray Rice had come out, the one of him striking his then fiancée in a casino elevator. Rice had earlier been handed a two-game suspension for the incident, but the latest evidence that was made public was too much for many &#8212; including Knighton, the Broncos’ defensive tackle &#8212; to bear. So Knighton said something. He said something bold and he said it at a time when many with fame and money choose to steer clear of contentious social issues. “I don’t give a damn who u are or how much money you make,” <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/08/terrance-knighton-ray-rice-tweets/29292/">he tweeted</a>. “No place for this. As players we always speak on how we are unfairly treated, well now what?” He has since spoken out on the <a href="https://twitter.com/MrKnighton2u/status/537069201140486145">Darren Wilson trial</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MrKnighton2u/status/540324093782798336">Eric Garner</a> case. He’s one of the few athletes who uses the platform he’s been given to speak out. For that, we salute him.
             <br /><span class="vote"><a href="#" class="pick" id="3" onClick="update_form('section_1', this); return false;">I pick Terrance Knighton</a></span>
        </p>
		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Jeff Bridich</font></strong>. The Rockies <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_26685903/dan-odowd-bill-geivett-resign-from-colorado-rockies">promoted Bridich</a>, their director of baseball operations since 2005, to general manager on Oct. 8. It was a sea change for the notoriously staid Colorado front office. Bridich replaced Dan O’Dowd after his 15 years in power, in which the Rockies played in just two postseasons. But Bridich also effectively replaced assistant GM Bill Geivett. Bridich’s consolidation of power wields a heavy influence on the Rockies, but his biggest task &#8212; bigger than dealing with Troy Tulowitzki trade rumors and scraping the barrel for pitching &#8212; will be carving out some autonomy in the front office and proving himself on his own The Rockies often talk about collaboration in their front office. And that’s nice &#8212; especially between Bridich and manager Walt Weiss. But it’s counterproductive to have someone above him making the decisions.

The Manimal made his mark on the court with a stellar end to last season, which faded into a national headline-making stint with USA Basketball. He won a gold medal, was named to the FIBA World Cup all-tournament team and then turned his NBA and international success into a four-year, $50 million contract extension. And all of this one year after he won the NBA’s “Kia Community Assist Award” in February for his philanthropic contributions, as well as the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, given by the Professional Basketball Writers Association to the player, coach, or trainer who shows outstanding service and dedication to the community. Those things haven’t stopped as Faried has continued to work toward the ideal of equality, tolerance and inclusion.

       <p><strong><font size="5.7em">SuperMascot Rocky</font></strong>. The Denver Nuggets of late have not been a championship-caliber team. Sure, they’ve had some recent teams that showed promise &#8212; ones that had stars, ones that had depth, ones that were well-coached. But no recent teams that were ready to win it all. And this year &#8212; after a 36-win 2013-14 season &#8212; is no different. What does set them apart, though, is Rocky. He’s the champion of mascots. <a href="http://www.nba.com/nuggets/rocky-most-awesome-mascot">He’s a Hall of Famer</a>. He’s the reason many fans still go to Nuggets games.

He did it with a savvy and pragmatic embrace of the core holdover players from the Steve Fairchild era &#8212; including quarterback Garrett Grayson, tackle Ty Sambrailo and linebackers Aaron Davis and Max Morgan &#8212; and adding talent behind them. Plus, his staff was an invigorating mix of veterans and young coaches, and it got the most out of the Rams. Now he’s off to Gainesville to see if he can do the same for the Florida Gators.

When Oscar Pareja bolted for Dallas last offseason, the Rapids handed the keys of a playoff-caliber team to club legend Pablo Mastroeni. Just months removed from retiring as a player, Mastroeni brought a thoughtful, philosophical approach to Commerce City, preaching hard work, teamwork and a de-emphasis on results. Early on it looked like a masterstroke by the Rapids’ front office, but injuries and a lack of defensive depth helped to spoil Mastroeni’s first season. His unorthodoxed lineup decisions frustrated his critics, and the Rapids slogged through a 14-game winless streak to miss the playoffs. For better or worse, Mastroeni was the most influential figure in Colorado soccer in 2014.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">AFC championship</font></strong>. On Jan. 19, for the first time since the Broncos opened Sports Authority Field at Mile High in 2001, confetti rained upon the field. Beating the perennial powerhouse Patriots, 26-16, further legitimized the Broncos’ first conference championship in 15 years.

Manning entered needing two TD passes to tie Brett Favre’s mark of 508, which Manning got in the first quarter with a three-yard completion to Emmanuel Sanders and a 20-yard catch-and-run by Wes Welker. The record-setting <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/10/21/watch-peyton-manning-micd-record-touchdown-509/30484/">509th career TD pass</a> fittingly went to top receiver Demaryius Thomas on an eight-yard pass near the right pylon late in the first half. The Broncos receivers then used the historic ball as a prop in a keep-away game from Manning, a celebration that was staged during a Friday practice by Manning himself. He finished the game with 510.

It was Colorado’s best series of 2014. They threw the sink at the Giants, winning with defense, hitting, starting pitching, the bullpen and base-running. That the Giants went on to win the World Series and the Rockies lost 96 games is an important illustration. The Rockies showed great promise, but seasons aren’t won in June. And the Rockies have a long way to go to be relevant in September

It was Colorado’s first complete game in Denver since 2011. Matzek’s debut year hinted at his potential, but his ups and downs should have been expected. He’ll need to improve going into 2015, but he's a key young piece in the Rockies’ rotation. Problem is, they need three Matzeks, or more. If he can work his way to the top of the rotation, though, it could go a long way to making the Rockies more competitive.

Their play had been up and down, and when the Nuggets faced the heavily favored L.A. Clippers on Feb. 3, they entered the game having lost two straight home games and in need of something good. Foye delivered. Taking a pass from J.J. Hickson on the game’s final play, Foye dribbled out to what seemed like Greeley before launching the shot. And as he held his breath &#8212; as the Pepsi Center crowd held its collective breath &#8212; the ball sailed a mile through the air and <a href="http://youtu.be/ydx6F7mzKnA" target="_blank">through the net</a>.

The Red Wings had just beaten the Blues in St. Louis, leaving the Blues and Avs even at 111 points in the standings. The Avs had the tiebreaker and went on to finish the season with 112 points. The party ended in Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs, against the Minnesota Wild, but Avs fans had reason to yell again.

Colorado returned its entire lineup from 2013 and was considered the prohibitive favorite to repeat as champion. That’s not an easy task, Wetmore said. “It’s so hard to be the favorites,” he said. “It’s so hard to have the attention, it’s so hard for them to keep their egos in check and they really did it.”

The Rapids were down 1-0 to the Vancouver Whitecaps on April 5 when a controversial 77th minute red card to Vancouver’s Matias Laba opened the door. Two minutes after going up a man, Rapids midfielder Jose Mari hit a long-range, physics-bending strike that pinged off the inside of the far post for the equalizer. Two minutes later, Mari capped off the comeback with a right-footed bender from just outside the penalty area.

As forgettable moments go, this one, on Feb. 2 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, was an all-timer. <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_25048459/broncos-peyton-manning-super-bowl-blowout-seahawks">Seattle 43, Broncos 8</a>. And it wasn’t that close. The first snap sailed over Peyton Manning’s head for a safety. Manning then threw one interception that led to a touchdown, and another that was returned for a touchdown. The Broncos were down, 22-0, at halftime. And then Seattle’s Percy Harvin returned the second-half kickoff for a touchdown and a 29-0 lead.

The Broncos’ defense seemed much improved with the free-agent additions of DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib and T.J. Ward. Von Miller was healthy again. Manning was playing better than ever. The Broncos were coming off back-to-back romps of San Francisco and San Diego on prime-time television.

Some of them read, “Denver doesn’t deserve a franchise,” and, “If product and experience that bad don’t come!” Monfort’s frustration was showing. But fans, giddy for a chance to show how much more frustrated they were than the owner, jumped on the pile. If there’s one takeaway from the weird ordeal, it’s this: Monfort, perhaps, needs to delegate some duties. Let Bridich do his thing as GM. And maybe auto-reply for emails.

He <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_26035613/rockies-yohan-flande-battles-major-league-debut-vs">debuted against the Cardinals’ Marco Gonzales</a>, just 22, on June 25. Flande’s start didn’t go well and he was middling the rest of the way. But it’s the big picture that’s the problem. Flande replaced Christian Bergman in the Rockies’ rotation, and Bergman made his big-league debut only as an injury replacement. Flande was the Rockies’ 12th starter &#8212; the most in the majors at the time &#8212; and they went on to use 15 during the season. They cycled in starters like they were on clearance. And, by extension, the Rockies gutted their Triple-A stock.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Avs blow it in Game 7</font></strong>. The Avs were unable to hold on to four one-goal leads in the deciding game of the first round as Wild defenseman Jared Spurgeon found the back of the net with 2:27 left in regulation. The Avs had three chances to score in OT, but Nino Neiderreiter struck first, at 5:02 into the extra period, to give the Wild <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/avalanche/ci_25673117/wild-outlast-avs-overtime-5-4">a 5-4 win</a> and a ticket to the next round. Said Avs forward Ryan O’Reilly: “We had moments where we played like a Cup team but other times when we didn’t look like we belonged at all.”

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Nuggets get injured. Again. And again. And again</font></strong>. Danilo Gallinari never came back from knee surgery. JaVale McGee was lost just a few games into the season with a stress fracture in his tibia. J.J. Hickson and Nate Robinson both suffered torn anterior cruciate ligaments in their knees. Ty Lawson played in the second-fewest games of his career. Injuries marred the 2013-14 season and were the biggest contributor to what turned out to be a 36-46 season.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">The Andre Miller saga</font></strong>. It was the most bizarre happening of the season. Mild-mannered Andre Miller <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/nuggets/ci_24831023/nuggets-lose-an-ugly-one-fall-hustling-philadelphia">snapped at coach Brian Shaw</a> while within earshot of everyone near the Nuggets’ bench during a game against the Sixers at Pepsi Center. It proved to be Miller’s last words in a Nuggets uniform. He was excused from the team the next day, and more than a month-and-a-half later, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/nuggets/ci_25191016/nuggets-looking-trade-andre-miller-by-deadline">finally traded</a>.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">CSU is rolled on Blue Turf</font></strong>.

Boise State ran up 676 yards of total offense and led 30-10 at halftime, and CSU could mount only 28 yards of rushing. The loss was the down point of the season, but it was the only one.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Panthers maul Buffs in NCAA tournament</font></strong>. Making an appearance in its third consecutive NCAA tournament, the CU men held high hopes entering their opening game at Orlando, against Pittsburgh. The Buffs never had a chance. Pitt led 46-18 at halftime and waltzed to <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/colleges/ci_25386085/cu-buffs-blown-out-by-pitt-ncaa-tournament">a 77-48 victory</a>. It was the second consecutive year that Colorado had been ousted after one game in the tournament. CU shot 35.7 percent and committed 17 turnovers, while Pittsburgh hit 50.8 percent and recorded just three turnovers.

It was the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_26480510/donovan-gets-2-goals-2-assists-la-beats">fastest red card in MLS history</a>. The Rapids, who played down a man for virtually the entire match, went on to lose 6-0, the most lopsided loss in franchise history and the club’s seventh consecutive loss &#8212; also a record.

An on-field melee ensued, resulting in the ejection of three Silverbacks players, two Silverbacks coaches, Rapids defender Marc Burch and Rapids coach Pablo Mastroeni. Despite playing with a two-man advantage for the game’s final half-hour, the Rapids couldn’t unlock the eight-man Silverbacks, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_26028482/rapids-eliminated-from-u-s-open-cup-game">losing 2-1</a>, their lone goal coming from the penalty spot.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">A ring</font></strong>. The Broncos spent the offseason reshaping their roster because of unfinished business: A magical 2013 season ended with a thud and a punch to the windpipe from the Seattle Seahawks. The Broncos now have a puncher’s chance that didn’t exist before the loss at St. Louis. If this team’s biggest concern is Peyton Manning’s arm strength, that’s a much better position to be in than wondering if the Broncos can figure out their running game, offensive line and special teams in Game 16. A third franchise Super Bowl title in Manning’s third season in Denver? It’s the most popular wish in Denver.

        </p>
		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">No retirement party</font></strong>. Maybe we became spoiled in just two years but &#8230; can you imagine Colorado sports without Peyton Manning?! It will soon be a reality, we know, but we’re hoping not for at least another year, maybe two. Since his Denver arrival in 2012, Manning has revived the Broncos and restored fans’ faith in the Orange and Blue. And in coming off a 36-win Nuggets season, a 66-win Rockies season, another lost year for CU football, the recent departure of CSU’s Jim McElwain, the second-worst Rapids season ever and an injury-riddled start to the Avs season, we’re begging you, Peyton: Don’t call it quits just yet. Give it another year. Better yet: Finish out your contract.

        </p>
		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Pitching, please</font></strong>. The Rockies, somewhat surprisingly, declined Brett Anderson’s $12 million contract option for the 2015 season. It was a steep cost for an oft-injured pitcher. But he’s a proven, talented starter, and the Rockies don’t have many of those. So add one more spot to fill. The Rockies’ rotation for 2015, for now, looks like: Jorge De La Rosa at No. 1, then, in no order, Jordan Lyles, Tyler Matzek and Jhoulys Chacin (if healthy). That’s about it. Plus, maybe, Flande and Bergman. Yikes.
            <br /><span class="vote"><a href="#" class="pick" id="3" onClick="update_form('section_4', this); return false;">This is my top wish for 2015</a></span>
        </p>
		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">See above</font></strong>. Seriously, they need more pitching. They REALLY need more pitching. Franklin Morales’ 22 starts last season were the second-most among Rockies pitchers. And he wasn’t even a starter. The Rockies could really use Eddie Butler and Jon Gray &#8212; but only if they prove in spring training they’re ready for the bigs. Even if they do, the Rockies need one or two more reliable starting pitchers. Better believe Bridich will press hard on the free-agent and trade markets, looking for more arms.

        </p>
		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Fewer doctor visits</font></strong>. The Nuggets just want a season with the normal amount of injuries to show what kind of team they can be. They are a talented and versatile bunch, admittedly without a superstar. A chance to show what the collection can do is what they ask.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Break ground on the new CSU stadium</font></strong>. After essentially three years of discussion, study and controversy, Colorado State president Tony Frank <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_27034358/csu-presidents-verdict-build-campus-stadium">made the recommendation</a> to move forward with the on-campus stadium and eventually abandon Hughes Stadium. After several years of implying &#8212; and even saying &#8212; that Hughes Stadium, opened in 1968, was inadequate, CSU needs to move forward or it could mitigate the football program's momentum.  As of now, the new stadium is tentatively slated to be ready for the 2017 season.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Bowl game for the Buffs</font></strong>. <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/colleges/ci_27041416/cu-buffs-football-program-tries-dig-out-deep">It has been a long time</a>. Colorado has not played in the postseason since 2007, when a Dan Hawkins-coached team faced Nick Saban's first Alabama team at the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, La. After spotting Alabama a 20-point first quarter lead, CU played well. The Buffs lost 30-24.  To become bowl eligible, Colorado must show a huge improvement. But Colorado fans can be encouraged by all the close games against Pac-12 teams in 2014 (including double-overtime losses to California and UCLA) with a Buffs lineup filled with sophomores.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">Rapids roster upgrade</font></strong>. One position of need is a target striker, following the announcement that <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_27010539/edson-buddle-among-11-rapids-players-whose-options">Edson Buddle’s contract option was not picked up</a>. And the Rapids have said they’re prepared to spend big money on another attacking player in 2015. They also need depth in central defense. Injuries to Shane O’Neill, Drew Moor and Jared Watts, coupled with a lack of MLS-ready depth behind them, were huge factors in the club’s 2014 demise. To that end, the Rapids have brought in Sporting Director Padraig Smith, who plans to use data analytics to help the club identify potential new acquisitions.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">New Rapids jersey sponsor (that pays)</font></strong>. The announcement of Ciao Telecom as the Rapids first-ever front-of-jersey sponsor in May was a celebrated moment in franchise history. By October, the Rapids had <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_26829372/colorado-rapids-sue-ciao-telecom-over-missed-sponsorship">filed a lawsuit</a> alleging they were owed nearly a half-million dollars in unpaid sponsorship fees. With both sides mum, locked in ongoing litigation, it appears the Rapids will soon be on the hunt for a new front-of-jersey sponsor. And if that doesn’t happen, they could always bring back Rapidman.

		<p><strong><font size="5.7em">An unforgettable ski world championships</font></strong>. Beaver Creek has hosted world ski championships twice before, but never with two hometown favorites being strong medal contenders. Here's hoping Lindsey Vonn can come back from the knee injury that kept her out of the Sochi Olympics and win medals in downhill and super-G, and that Mikaela Shiffrin can win multiple medals on a mountain four miles from her home. It would be great to see Ted Ligety defend his world championships medal in giant slalom, and to see 37-year-old Bode Miller be the king of the mountain one more time. Feb. 2-15 will be interesting.
